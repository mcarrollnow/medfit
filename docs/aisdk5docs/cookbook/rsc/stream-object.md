# [Stream Object](#stream-object)




This example uses React Server Components (RSC). If you want to client side rendering and hooks instead, check out the ["streaming object generation" example with useObject](../next/stream-object.html).



Object generation can sometimes take a long time to complete, especially when you're generating a large schema. In such cases, it is useful to stream the object generation process to the client in real-time. This allows the client to display the generated object as it is being generated, rather than have users wait for it to complete before displaying the result.

View Notifications





## [Client](#client)

Let's create a simple React component that will call the `getNotifications` function when a button is clicked. The function will generate a list of notifications as described in the schema.












``` tsx
'use client';
import  from 'react';import  from './actions';import  from '@ai-sdk/rsc';
// Allow streaming responses up to 30 secondsexport const maxDuration = 30;
export default function Home()  = await generate('Messages during finals week.');
          for await (const partialObject of readStreamableValue(object))           }        }}      >        Ask      </button>
      <pre></pre>    </div>  );}
```


## [Server](#server)

Now let's implement the `getNotifications` function. We'll use the `generateObject` function to generate the list of fictional notifications based on the schema we defined earlier.












``` typescript
'use server';
import  from 'ai';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from '@ai-sdk/rsc';import  from 'zod';
export async function generate(input: string)  = streamObject(),        ),      }),    });
    for await (const partialObject of partialObjectStream) 
    stream.done();  })();
  return ;}
```
