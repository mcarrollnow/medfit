# [Call Tools in Parallel](#call-tools-in-parallel)

Some language models support calling tools in parallel. This is particularly useful when multiple tools are independent of each other and can be executed in parallel during the same generation step.

## [Client](#client)

Let's modify our previous example to call `getWeather` tool for multiple cities in parallel.












``` tsx
'use client';
import  from 'react';import  from './actions';
// Allow streaming responses up to 30 secondsexport const maxDuration = 30;
export default function Home() >            :           </div>        ))}      </div>
      <div>        <input          type="text"          value=          onChange=}        />        <button          onClick= = await continueConversation([              ...conversation,              ,            ]);
            setConversation(messages);          }}        >          Send Message        </button>      </div>    </div>  );}
```


## [Server](#server)

Let's update the tools object to now use the `getWeather` function instead.












``` ts
'use server';
import  from 'ai';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'zod';
export interface Message 
function getWeather() ;}
export async function continueConversation(history: Message[])  = await generateText(),        execute: async () => );          return `It is currently $°$ and $ in $!`;        },      },    },  });
  return ,    ],  };}
```
