# [Generate Text with Chat Prompt](#generate-text-with-chat-prompt)

Previously, we were able to generate text and objects using either a single message prompt, a system prompt, or a combination of both of them. However, there may be times when you want to generate text based on a series of messages.

A chat completion allows you to generate text based on a series of messages. This series of messages can be any series of interactions between any number of systems, but the most popular and relatable use case has been a series of messages that represent a conversation between a user and a model.












http://localhost:3000









User: How is it going?



Assistant: All good, how may I help you?







Why is the sky blue?







Send Message






## [Client](#client)

Let's create a simple conversation between a user and a model, and place a button that will call `continueConversation`.












``` tsx
'use client';
import  from 'react';import  from './actions';
// Allow streaming responses up to 30 secondsexport const maxDuration = 30;
export default function Home() >            :           </div>        ))}      </div>
      <div>        <input          type="text"          value=          onChange=}        />        <button          onClick= = await continueConversation([              ...conversation,              ,            ]);
            setConversation(messages);          }}        >          Send Message        </button>      </div>    </div>  );}
```


## [Server](#server)

Now, let's implement the `continueConversation` function that will insert the user's message into the conversation and generate a response.












``` typescript
'use server';
import  from 'ai';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';
export interface Message 
export async function continueConversation(history: Message[])  = await generateText();
  return ,    ],  };}
```
