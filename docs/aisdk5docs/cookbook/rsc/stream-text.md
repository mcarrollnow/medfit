# [Stream Text](#stream-text)




This example uses React Server Components (RSC). If you want to client side rendering and hooks instead, check out the ["stream text" example with useCompletion](../next/stream-text.html).



Text generation can sometimes take a long time to complete, especially when you're generating a couple of paragraphs. In such cases, it is useful to stream the text generation process to the client in real-time. This allows the client to display the generated text as it is being generated, rather than have users wait for it to complete before displaying the result.

## [Client](#client)

Let's create a simple React component that will call the `generate` function when a button is clicked. The `generate` function will call the `streamText` function, which will then generate text based on the input prompt. To consume the stream of text in the client, we will use the `readStreamableValue` function from the `@ai-sdk/rsc` module.












``` tsx
'use client';
import  from 'react';import  from './actions';import  from '@ai-sdk/rsc';
// Allow streaming responses up to 30 secondsexport const maxDuration = 30;
export default function Home()  = await generate('Why is the sky blue?');
          for await (const delta of readStreamableValue(output)) $`);          }        }}      >        Ask      </button>
      <div></div>    </div>  );}
```


## [Server](#server)

On the server side, we need to implement the `generate` function, which will call the `streamText` function. The `streamText` function will generate text based on the input prompt. In order to stream the text generation to the client, we will use `createStreamableValue` that can wrap any changeable value and stream it to the client.

Using DevTools, we can see the text generation being streamed to the client in real-time.












``` typescript
'use server';
import  from 'ai';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from '@ai-sdk/rsc';
export async function generate(input: string)  = streamText();
    for await (const delta of textStream) 
    stream.done();  })();
  return ;}
```
