# [Generate Text](#generate-text)




This example uses React Server Components (RSC). If you want to client side rendering and hooks instead, check out the ["generate text" example with useState](../next/generate-text.html).



A situation may arise when you need to generate text based on a prompt. For example, you may want to generate a response to a question or summarize a body of text. The `generateText` function can be used to generate text based on the input prompt.

## [Client](#client)

Let's create a simple React component that will call the `getAnswer` function when a button is clicked. The `getAnswer` function will call the `generateText` function from the `ai` module, which will then generate text based on the input prompt.












``` tsx
'use client';
import  from 'react';import  from './actions';
// Allow streaming responses up to 30 secondsexport const maxDuration = 30;
export default function Home()  = await getAnswer('Why is the sky blue?');          setGeneration(text);        }}      >        Answer      </button>      <div></div>    </div>  );}
```


## [Server](#server)

On the server side, we need to implement the `getAnswer` function, which will call the `generateText` function from the `ai` module. The `generateText` function will generate text based on the input prompt.












``` typescript
'use server';
import  from 'ai';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';
export async function getAnswer(question: string)  = await generateText();
  return ;}
```
