# [Generate Object](#generate-object)




This example uses React Server Components (RSC). If you want to client side rendering and hooks instead, check out the ["generate object" example with useState](../next/generate-object.html).



Earlier functions like `generateText` and `streamText` gave us the ability to generate unstructured text. However, if you want to generate structured data like JSON, you can provide a schema that describes the structure of your desired object to the `generateObject` function.

View Notifications





## [Client](#client)

Let's create a simple React component that will call the `getNotifications` function when a button is clicked. The function will generate a list of notifications as described in the schema.












``` tsx
'use client';
import  from 'react';import  from './actions';
// Allow streaming responses up to 30 secondsexport const maxDuration = 30;
export default function Home()  = await getNotifications(            'Messages during finals week.',          );
          setGeneration(JSON.stringify(notifications, null, 2));        }}      >        View Notifications      </button>
      <pre></pre>    </div>  );}
```


## [Server](#server)

Now let's implement the `getNotifications` function. We'll use the `generateObject` function to generate the list of notifications based on the schema we defined earlier.












``` typescript
'use server';
import  from 'ai';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'zod';
export async function getNotifications(input: string)  = await generateObject(),      ),    }),  });
  return ;}
```
