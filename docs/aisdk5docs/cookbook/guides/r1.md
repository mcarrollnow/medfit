# [Get started with DeepSeek R1](#get-started-with-deepseek-r1)


The [AI SDK](../../index.html) is a powerful TypeScript toolkit for building AI applications with large language models (LLMs) like DeepSeek R1 alongside popular frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more.

## [DeepSeek R1](#deepseek-r1)

DeepSeek R1 is a series of advanced AI models designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks in science, coding, and mathematics. These models are optimized to "think before they answer," producing detailed internal chains of thought that aid in solving challenging problems.

The series includes two primary variants:

- **DeepSeek R1-Zero**: Trained exclusively with reinforcement learning (RL) without any supervised fine-tuning. It exhibits advanced reasoning capabilities but may struggle with readability and formatting.
- **DeepSeek R1**: Combines reinforcement learning with cold-start data and supervised fine-tuning to improve both reasoning performance and the readability of outputs.

### [Benchmarks](#benchmarks)

DeepSeek R1 models excel in reasoning tasks, delivering competitive performance across key benchmarks:

- **AIME 2024 (Pass@1)**: 79.8%
- **MATH-500 (Pass@1)**: 97.3%
- **Codeforces (Percentile)**: Top 4% (96.3%)
- **GPQA Diamond (Pass@1)**: 71.5%


### [Prompt Engineering for DeepSeek R1 Models](#prompt-engineering-for-deepseek-r1-models)

DeepSeek R1 models excel with structured and straightforward prompts. The following best practices can help achieve optimal performance:

1.  **Use a structured format**: Leverage the model’s preferred output structure with `<think>` tags for reasoning and `<answer>` tags for the final result.
2.  **Prefer zero-shot prompts**: Avoid few-shot prompting as it can degrade performance; instead, directly state the problem clearly.
3.  **Specify output expectations**: Guide the model by defining desired formats, such as markdown for readability or XML-like tags for clarity.

## [Getting Started with the AI SDK](#getting-started-with-the-ai-sdk)

The AI SDK is the TypeScript toolkit designed to help developers build AI-powered applications with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more. Integrating LLMs into applications is complicated and heavily dependent on the specific model provider you use.

The AI SDK abstracts away the differences between model providers, eliminates boilerplate code for building chatbots, and allows you to go beyond text output to generate rich, interactive components.

At the center of the AI SDK is [AI SDK Core](../../docs/ai-sdk-core/overview.html), which provides a unified API to call any LLM. The code snippet below is all you need to call DeepSeek R1 with the AI SDK:



``` ts
import  from '@ai-sdk/deepseek';import  from 'ai';
const  = await generateText();
```


The unified interface also means that you can easily switch between providers by changing just two lines of code. For example, to use DeepSeek R1 via Fireworks:



``` ts
import  from '@ai-sdk/fireworks';import  from 'ai';
// middleware to extract reasoning tokensconst enhancedModel = wrapLanguageModel(),});
const  = await generateText();
```


Or to use Groq's `deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b` model:



``` ts
import  from '@ai-sdk/groq';import  from 'ai';
// middleware to extract reasoning tokensconst enhancedModel = wrapLanguageModel(),});
const  = await generateText();
```





The AI SDK provides a [middleware](../../docs/ai-sdk-core/middleware.html) (`extractReasoningMiddleware`) that can be used to extract the reasoning tokens from the model's output.

When using DeepSeek-R1 series models with third-party providers like Together AI, we recommend using the `startWithReasoning` option in the `extractReasoningMiddleware` function, as they tend to bypass thinking patterns.



### [Model Provider Comparison](#model-provider-comparison)

You can use DeepSeek R1 with the AI SDK through various providers. Here's a comparison of the providers that support DeepSeek R1:


| Provider | Model ID | Reasoning Tokens |
|----|----|----|


### [Building Interactive Interfaces](#building-interactive-interfaces)

AI SDK Core can be paired with [AI SDK UI](../../docs/ai-sdk-ui/overview.html), another powerful component of the AI SDK, to streamline the process of building chat, completion, and assistant interfaces with popular frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt, and SvelteKit.

AI SDK UI provides robust abstractions that simplify the complex tasks of managing chat streams and UI updates on the frontend, enabling you to develop dynamic AI-driven interfaces more efficiently.

With four main hooks — [`useChat`](../../docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat.html), [`useCompletion`](../../docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-completion.html), and [`useObject`](../../docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-object.html) — you can incorporate real-time chat capabilities, text completions, streamed JSON, and interactive assistant features into your app.


In a new Next.js application, first install the AI SDK and the DeepSeek provider:



``` geist-overflow-scroll-y
pnpm install ai @ai-sdk/deepseek @ai-sdk/react
```










Then, create a route handler for the chat endpoint:












``` tsx
import  from '@ai-sdk/deepseek';import  from 'ai';
export async function POST(req: Request) :  = await req.json();
  const result = streamText();
  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();}
```





You can forward the model's reasoning tokens to the client with `sendReasoning: true` in the `toDataStreamResponse` method.



Finally, update the root page (`app/page.tsx`) to use the `useChat` hook:












``` tsx
'use client';
import  from '@ai-sdk/react';import  from 'react';
export default function Page()  = useChat();
  const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => );      setInput('');    }  };
  return (    <>      >                    ></pre>;            }            if (part.type === 'text') ></span>;            }            return null;          })}        </div>      ))}      <form onSubmit=>        <input          name="prompt"          value=          onChange=        />        <button type="submit">Submit</button>      </form>    </>  );}
```





You can access the model's reasoning tokens through the `parts` array on the `message` object, where reasoning parts have `type: 'reasoning'`.



The useChat hook on your root page (`app/page.tsx`) will make a request to your AI provider endpoint (`app/api/chat/route.ts`) whenever the user submits a message. The messages are then displayed in the chat UI.

## [Limitations](#limitations)

While DeepSeek R1 models are powerful, they have certain limitations:

- No tool-calling support: DeepSeek R1 cannot directly interact with APIs or external tools.
- No object generation support: DeepSeek R1 does not support structured object generation. However, you can combine it with models that support structured object generation (like gpt-4o-mini) to generate objects. See the [structured object generation with a reasoning model recipe](../node/generate-object-reasoning.html) for more information.
