# [Generate and Edit Images with Google Gemini 2.5 Flash](#generate-and-edit-images-with-google-gemini-25-flash)

This guide will show you how to generate and edit images with the AI SDK and Google's latest multimodal language model Gemini 2.5 Flash Image.

## [Generating Images](#generating-images)

As Gemini 2.5 Flash Image is a language model with multimodal capabilities, you can use the `generateText` or `streamText` functions (not `generateImage`) to create images. The model determines which modality to respond in based on your prompt and configuration. Here's how to create your first image:



``` ts
import  from '@ai-sdk/google';import  from 'ai';import fs from 'node:fs';import 'dotenv/config';
async function generateImage() );
  // Save generated images  for (const file of result.files) .png`;
      fs.mkdirSync('output', );      await fs.promises.writeFile(`output/$`, file.uint8Array);
      console.log(`Generated and saved image: output/$`);    }  }}
generateImage().catch(console.error);
```


Here are some key points to remember:

- Generated images are returned in the `result.files` array
- Images are returned as `Uint8Array` data
- The model leverages Gemini's world knowledge, so detailed prompts yield better results

## [Editing Images](#editing-images)

Gemini 2.5 Flash Image excels at editing existing images with natural language instructions. You can add elements, modify styles, or transform images while maintaining their core characteristics:



``` ts
import  from '@ai-sdk/google';import  from 'ai';import fs from 'node:fs';import 'dotenv/config';
async function editImage() ,          ,        ],      },    ],  });
  // Save the edited image  const timestamp = Date.now();  fs.mkdirSync('output', );
  for (const file of editResult.files) .png`,        file.uint8Array,      );      console.log(`Saved edited image: output/edited-$.png`);    }  }}
editImage().catch(console.error);
```
