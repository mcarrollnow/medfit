# [Get started with OpenAI o1](#get-started-with-openai-o1)


The [AI SDK](../../index.html) is a powerful TypeScript toolkit for building AI applications with large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI o1 alongside popular frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more.

## [OpenAI o1](#openai-o1)

OpenAI released a series of AI models designed to spend more time thinking before responding. They can reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science, coding, and math. These models, named the o1 series, are trained with reinforcement learning and can "think before they answer". As a result, they are able to produce a long internal chain of thought before responding to a prompt.

The main reasoning model available in the API is:



| Model | Streaming | Tools | Object Generation | Reasoning Effort |
|----|----|----|----|----|


### [Benchmarks](#benchmarks)

OpenAI o1 models excel in scientific reasoning, with impressive performance across various domains:

- Ranking in the 89th percentile on competitive programming questions (Codeforces)
- Placing among the top 500 students in the US in a qualifier for the USA Math Olympiad (AIME)
- Exceeding human PhD-level accuracy on a benchmark of physics, biology, and chemistry problems (GPQA)


### [Prompt Engineering for o1 Models](#prompt-engineering-for-o1-models)

The o1 models perform best with straightforward prompts. Some prompt engineering techniques, like few-shot prompting or instructing the model to "think step by step," may not enhance performance and can sometimes hinder it. Here are some best practices:

1.  Keep prompts simple and direct: The models excel at understanding and responding to brief, clear instructions without the need for extensive guidance.
2.  Avoid chain-of-thought prompts: Since these models perform reasoning internally, prompting them to "think step by step" or "explain your reasoning" is unnecessary.
3.  Use delimiters for clarity: Use delimiters like triple quotation marks, XML tags, or section titles to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input, helping the model interpret different sections appropriately.
4.  Limit additional context in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG): When providing additional context or documents, include only the most relevant information to prevent the model from overcomplicating its response.

## [Getting Started with the AI SDK](#getting-started-with-the-ai-sdk)

The AI SDK is the TypeScript toolkit designed to help developers build AI-powered applications with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more. Integrating LLMs into applications is complicated and heavily dependent on the specific model provider you use.

The AI SDK abstracts away the differences between model providers, eliminates boilerplate code for building chatbots, and allows you to go beyond text output to generate rich, interactive components.

At the center of the AI SDK is [AI SDK Core](../../docs/ai-sdk-core/overview.html), which provides a unified API to call any LLM. The code snippet below is all you need to call OpenAI o1 with the AI SDK:



``` ts
import  from 'ai';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';
const  = await generateText();
```





To use the o1 model, you must either be using @ai-sdk/openai version 0.0.59 or greater, or set `temperature: 1`.



AI SDK Core abstracts away the differences between model providers, allowing you to focus on building great applications. The unified interface also means that you can easily switch between models by changing just one line of code.



``` ts
import  from 'ai';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';
const  = await generateText();
```





System messages are automatically converted to OpenAI developer messages.



### [Refining Reasoning Effort](#refining-reasoning-effort)

You can control the amount of reasoning effort expended by o1 through the `reasoningEffort` parameter. This parameter can be set to `'low'`, `'medium'`, or `'high'` to adjust how much time and computation the model spends on internal reasoning before producing a response.



``` ts
import  from 'ai';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';
// Reduce reasoning effort for faster responsesconst  = await generateText(,  },});
```





The `reasoningEffort` parameter is only supported by o1 and has no effect on other models.



### [Generating Structured Data](#generating-structured-data)

While text generation can be useful, you might want to generate structured JSON data. For example, you might want to extract information from text, classify data, or generate synthetic data. AI SDK Core provides two functions ([`generateObject`](../../docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-object.html) and [`streamObject`](../../docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-object.html)) to generate structured data, allowing you to constrain model outputs to a specific schema.



``` ts
import  from 'ai';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'zod';
const  = await generateObject()),      steps: z.array(z.string()),    }),  }),  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',});
```


This code snippet will generate a type-safe recipe that conforms to the specified zod schema.






### [Tools](#tools)

While LLMs have incredible generation capabilities, they struggle with discrete tasks (e.g. mathematics) and interacting with the outside world (e.g. getting the weather). The solution: [tools](../../docs/foundations/tools.html), which are like programs that you provide to the model, which it can choose to call as necessary.

### [Using Tools with the AI SDK](#using-tools-with-the-ai-sdk)

The AI SDK supports tool usage across several of its functions, like [`generateText`](../../docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-text.html) and [`streamText`](../../docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text.html). By passing one or more tools to the `tools` parameter, you can extend the capabilities of LLMs, allowing them to perform discrete tasks and interact with external systems.

Here's an example of how you can use a tool with the AI SDK and o1:



``` ts
import  from 'ai';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'zod';
const  = await generateText(),      execute: async () => (),    }),  },});
```


In this example, the `getWeather` tool allows the model to fetch real-time weather data (simulated for simplicity), enhancing its ability to provide accurate and up-to-date information.






### [Building Interactive Interfaces](#building-interactive-interfaces)

AI SDK Core can be paired with [AI SDK UI](../../docs/ai-sdk-ui/overview.html), another powerful component of the AI SDK, to streamline the process of building chat, completion, and assistant interfaces with popular frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt, and SvelteKit.

AI SDK UI provides robust abstractions that simplify the complex tasks of managing chat streams and UI updates on the frontend, enabling you to develop dynamic AI-driven interfaces more efficiently.

With four main hooks — [`useChat`](../../docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat.html), [`useCompletion`](../../docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-completion.html), and [`useObject`](../../docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-object.html) — you can incorporate real-time chat capabilities, text completions, streamed JSON, and interactive assistant features into your app.













``` tsx
import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'ai';
// Allow responses up to 5 minutesexport const maxDuration = 300;
export async function POST(req: Request) :  = await req.json();
  const result = streamText();
  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();}
```













``` tsx
'use client';
import  from '@ai-sdk/react';
export default function Page()  = useChat();
  return (    <>      >                            </div>      ))}      <form onSubmit=>        <input name="prompt" value= onChange= />        <button type="submit">Submit</button>      </form>    </>  );}
```


The useChat hook on your root page (`app/page.tsx`) will make a request to your AI provider endpoint (`app/api/chat/route.ts`) whenever the user submits a message. The messages are then displayed in the chat UI.
