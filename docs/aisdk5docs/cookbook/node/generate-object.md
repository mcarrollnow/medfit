# [Generate Object](#generate-object)

Earlier functions like `generateText` and `streamText` gave us the ability to generate unstructured text. However, if you want to generate structured data like JSON, you can provide a schema that describes the structure of your desired object to the `generateObject` function.




``` ts
import  from 'ai';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'zod';
const result = await generateObject(),      ),      steps: z.array(z.string()),    }),  }),  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',});
console.log(JSON.stringify(result.object.recipe, null, 2));
```
