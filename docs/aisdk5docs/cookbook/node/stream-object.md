# [Stream Object](#stream-object)

Object generation can sometimes take a long time to complete, especially when you're generating a large schema.

In Generative UI use cases, it is useful to stream the object to the client in real-time to render UIs as the object is being generated. You can use the [`streamObject`](../../docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-object.html) function to generate partial object streams.



``` ts
import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'ai';import  from 'zod';
const  = streamObject(),  }),  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',});
for await (const partialObject of partialObjectStream) 
```
