# [Stream Text with File Prompt](#stream-text-with-file-prompt)

Working with files in AI applications often requires analyzing documents, processing structured data, or extracting information from various file formats. File prompts allow you to send file content directly to the model, enabling tasks like document analysis, data extraction, or generating responses based on file contents.



``` ts
import  from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';import  from 'ai';import 'dotenv/config';import fs from 'node:fs';
async function main() ,          ,        ],      },    ],  });
  for await (const textPart of result.textStream) }
main().catch(console.error);
```
