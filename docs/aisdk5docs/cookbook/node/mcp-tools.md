# [MCP Tools](#mcp-tools)

The AI SDK supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools by offering a lightweight client that exposes a `tools` method for retrieving tools from a MCP server. After use, the client should always be closed to release resources.

Use the official Model Context Protocol Typescript SDK to create the connection to the MCP server.



``` geist-overflow-scroll-y
pnpm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
```












``` ts
import  from 'ai';import  from 'ai/mcp-stdio';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio';import  from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/sse';import  from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/streamableHttp';
let clientOne;let clientTwo;let clientThree;
try );
  const clientOne = await experimental_createMCPClient();
  // You can also connect to StreamableHTTP MCP servers  const httpTransport = new StreamableHTTPClientTransport(    new URL('http://localhost:3000/mcp'),  );  const clientTwo = await experimental_createMCPClient();
  // Alternatively, you can connect to a Server-Sent Events (SSE) MCP server:  const sseTransport = new SSEClientTransport(    new URL('http://localhost:3000/sse'),  );  const clientThree = await experimental_createMCPClient();
  const toolSetOne = await clientOne.tools();  const toolSetTwo = await clientTwo.tools();  const toolSetThree = await clientThree.tools();  const tools = ;
  const response = await generateText(],      },    ],  });
  console.log(response.text);} catch (error)  finally
