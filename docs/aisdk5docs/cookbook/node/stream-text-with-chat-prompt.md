# [Stream Text with Chat Prompt](#stream-text-with-chat-prompt)

Text generation can sometimes take a long time to finish, especially when the response is big. In such cases, it is useful to stream the chat completion to the client in real-time. This allows the client to display the new message as it is being generated by the model, rather than have users wait for it to finish.



``` ts
import  from 'ai';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';
const result = streamText(],    },    ],    },    ],    },  ],});
for await (const textPart of result.textStream) 
```
