# [Call Tools with Image Prompt](#call-tools-with-image-prompt)

Some language models that support vision capabilities accept images as part of the prompt. Here are some of the different [formats](../../docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-text.html#content-image) you can use to include images as input.



``` ts
import  from 'ai';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'zod';
const result = await generateText(,        ,      ],    },  ],  tools: ),      execute() ); // your implementation here      },    }),  },});
```
