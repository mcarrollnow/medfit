# [Generate Object with a Reasoning Model](#generate-object-with-a-reasoning-model)

Reasoning models, like [DeepSeek's](../../providers/ai-sdk-providers/deepseek.html) R1, are gaining popularity due to their ability to understand and generate better responses to complex queries than non-reasoning models. You may want to use these models to generate structured data. However, most (like R1 and [OpenAI's](../../providers/ai-sdk-providers/openai.html) o1) do not support tool-calling or structured outputs.

One solution is to pass the output from a reasoning model through a smaller model that can output structured data (like gpt-4o-mini). These lightweight models can efficiently extract the structured data while adding very little overhead in terms of speed and cost.



``` ts
import  from '@ai-sdk/deepseek';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'ai';import 'dotenv/config';import  from 'zod';
async function main()  = await generateText();
  const  = await generateObject(),    output: 'array',  });
  console.log(object);}
main().catch(console.error);
```
