# [Retrieval Augmented Generation](#retrieval-augmented-generation)

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances the capabilities of language models by providing them with relevant information from external sources during the generation process. This approach allows the model to access and incorporate up-to-date or specific knowledge that may not be present in its original training data.





``` ts
import fs from 'fs';import path from 'path';import dotenv from 'dotenv';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'ai';
dotenv.config();
async function main() [] = [];
  const essay = fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'essay.txt'), 'utf8');  const chunks = essay    .split('.')    .map(chunk => chunk.trim())    .filter(chunk => chunk.length > 0 && chunk !== '\n');
  const  = await embedMany();  embeddings.forEach((e, i) => );  });
  const input =    'What were the two main things the author worked on before college?';
  const  = await embed();  const context = db    .map(item => ())    .sort((a, b) => b.similarity - a.similarity)    .slice(0, 3)    .map(r => r.document.value)    .join('\n');
  const  = await generateText(
             Question: $`,  });  console.log(text);}
main().catch(console.error);
