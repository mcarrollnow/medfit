# [Generate Text with Chat Prompt](#generate-text-with-chat-prompt)

Previously, we were able to generate text and objects using either a single message prompt, a system prompt, or a combination of both of them. However, there may be times when you want to generate text based on a series of messages.

A chat completion allows you to generate text based on a series of messages. This series of messages can be any series of interactions between any number of systems, but the most popular and relatable use case has been a series of messages that represent a conversation between a user and a model.



``` ts
import  from 'ai';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';
const result = await generateText(],    },    ],    },    ],    },  ],});
console.log(result.text);
```
