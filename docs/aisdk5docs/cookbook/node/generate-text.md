# [Generate Text](#generate-text)

The most basic LLM use case is generating text based on a prompt. For example, you may want to generate a response to a question or summarize a body of text. The `generateText` function can be used to generate text based on the input prompt.



``` ts
import  from 'ai';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';
const result = await generateText();
console.log(result);
```
