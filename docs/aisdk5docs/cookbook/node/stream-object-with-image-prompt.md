# [Stream Object with Image Prompt](#stream-object-with-image-prompt)

Some language models that support vision capabilities accept images as part of the prompt. Here are some of the different [formats](../../docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-text.html#content-image) you can use to include images as input.

## [URL](#url)



``` ts
import  from 'ai';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import dotenv from 'dotenv';import  from 'zod';
dotenv.config();
async function main()  = streamObject(),      ),    }),    messages: [      ,          ,        ],      },    ],  });
  for await (const partialObject of partialObjectStream) }
main();
```


## [File Buffer](#file-buffer)



``` ts
import  from 'ai';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import dotenv from 'dotenv';import  from 'zod';import fs from 'fs';
dotenv.config();
async function main()  = streamObject(),      ),    }),    messages: [      ,          ),          },        ],      },    ],  });
