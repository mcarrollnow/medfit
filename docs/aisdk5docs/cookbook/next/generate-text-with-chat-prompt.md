# [Generate Text with Chat Prompt](#generate-text-with-chat-prompt)

Previously, you were able to generate text and objects using either a single message prompt, a system prompt, or a combination of both of them. However, there may be times when you want to generate text based on a series of messages.

A chat completion allows you to generate text based on a series of messages. This series of messages can be any series of interactions between any number of systems, but the most popular and relatable use case has been a series of messages that represent a conversation between a user and a model.












http://localhost:3000









User: How is it going?



Assistant: All good, how may I help you?







Why is the sky blue?

## [Client](#client)

Let's start by creating a simple chat interface with an input field that sends the user's message and displays the conversation history. You will call the `/api/chat` endpoint to generate the assistant's response.












``` tsx
'use client';
import type  from 'ai';import  from 'react';
export default function Page()         onChange=}        onKeyDown=,            ]);
            const response = await fetch('/api/chat', ],              }),            });
            const  = await response.json();
            setMessages(currentMessages => [              ...currentMessages,              ...newMessages,            ]);          }        }}      />
      -$`}>          ></div>                ))}        </div>      ))}    </div>  );}
```


## [Server](#server)

Next, let's create the `/api/chat` endpoint that generates the assistant's response based on the conversation history.












``` typescript
import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'ai';
export async function POST(req: Request) :  = await req.json();
  const  = await generateText();
  return Response.json();}
```
