# [Stream Text](#stream-text)

Text generation can sometimes take a long time to complete, especially when you're generating a couple of paragraphs. In such cases, it is useful to stream the text generation process to the client in real-time. This allows the client to display the generated text as it is being generated, rather than have users wait for it to complete before displaying the result.

Answer





## [Client](#client)

Let's create a simple React component that imports the `useCompletion` hook from the `@ai-sdk/react` module. The `useCompletion` hook will call the `/api/completion` endpoint when a button is clicked. The endpoint will generate text based on the input prompt and stream it to the client.












``` tsx
'use client';
import  from '@ai-sdk/react';
export default function Page()  = useCompletion();
  return (    <div>      <div        onClick=}      >        Generate      </div>
          </div>  );}
```


## [Server](#server)

Let's create a route handler for `/api/completion` that will generate text based on the input prompt. The route will call the `streamText` function from the `ai` module, which will then generate text based on the input prompt and stream it to the client.












``` typescript
import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'ai';
export async function POST(req: Request) :  = await req.json();
  const result = streamText();
  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();}
```
