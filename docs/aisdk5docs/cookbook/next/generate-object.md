# [Generate Object](#generate-object)

Earlier functions like `generateText` and `streamText` gave us the ability to generate unstructured text. However, if you want to generate structured data like JSON, you can provide a schema that describes the structure of your desired object to the `generateObject` function.

## [Client](#client)

Let's create a simple React component that will make a POST request to the `/api/completion` endpoint when a button is clicked. The endpoint will return the generated object based on the input prompt and we'll display it.












``` tsx
'use client';
import  from 'react';
export default function Page() ),          }).then(response => );          });        }}      >        Generate      </div>
      </pre>      )}    </div>  );}
```


## [Server](#server)

Let's create a route handler for `/api/completion` that will generate an object based on the input prompt. The route will call the `generateObject` function from the `ai` module, which will then generate an object based on the input prompt and return it.












``` typescript
import  from 'ai';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'zod';
export async function POST(req: Request) :  = await req.json();
  const result = await generateObject(),      ),    }),  });
  return result.toJsonResponse();}
```
