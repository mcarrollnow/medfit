# [Stream Text with Chat Prompt](#stream-text-with-chat-prompt)

Chat completion can sometimes take a long time to finish, especially when the response is big. In such cases, it is useful to stream the chat completion to the client in real-time. This allows the client to display the new message as it is being generated by the model, rather than have users wait for it to finish.












http://localhost:3000









User: How is it going?



Assistant: All good, how may I help you?







Why is the sky blue?







Send Message






## [Client](#client)

Let's create a React component that imports the `useChat` hook from the `@ai-sdk/react` module. The `useChat` hook will call the `/api/chat` endpoint when the user sends a message. The endpoint will generate the assistant's response based on the conversation history and stream it to the client.












``` tsx
'use client';
import  from '@ai-sdk/react';import  from 'ai';import  from 'react';
export default function Page()  = useChat(),  });
  return (    <div>      <input        value=        onChange=}        onKeyDown=],            });          }        }}      />
      >          -text`}></div>;            }          })}        </div>      ))}    </div>  );}
```


## [Server](#server)

Next, let's create the `/api/chat` endpoint that generates the assistant's response based on the conversation history.












``` typescript
import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'ai';
export async function POST(req: Request) :  = await req.json();
  const result = streamText();
  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();}
```
