# [Generate Text](#generate-text)

A situation may arise when you need to generate text based on a prompt. For example, you may want to generate a response to a question or summarize a body of text. The `generateText` function can be used to generate text based on the input prompt.

Answer





## [Client](#client)

Let's create a simple React component that will make a POST request to the `/api/completion` endpoint when a button is clicked. The endpoint will generate text based on the input prompt.












``` tsx
'use client';
import  from 'react';
export default function Page() ),          }).then(response => );          });        }}      >        Generate      </div>
          </div>  );}
```


## [Server](#server)

Let's create a route handler for `/api/completion` that will generate text based on the input prompt. The route will call the `generateText` function from the `ai` module, which will then generate text based on the input prompt and return it.












``` typescript
import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'ai';
export async function POST(req: Request) :  = await req.json();
  const  = await generateText();
  return Response.json();}
```
