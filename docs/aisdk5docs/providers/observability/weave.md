# [Weave Observability](#weave-observability)


After integrating with the AI SDK, you can use Weave to view and interact with trace information for your AI SDK application including prompts, responses, flow, cost and more.

## [Setup](#setup)


### [Authentication](#authentication)




``` bash
echo -n "api:<YOUR_API_KEY>" | base64
```


Note the output. You'll use it in your environment configuration.

### [Project Configuration](#project-configuration)

Your W&B project ID identifies where your telemetry data will be logged. It follows the format `<YOUR_TEAM_NAME>/<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`.

2.  In the **Teams** section, select or create a team.
3.  Select an existing project or create a new one.
4.  Note `<YOUR_TEAM_NAME>/<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>` for the next step.

### [Next.js](#nextjs)

In your Next.js app’s `.env` file, set the OTEL environment variables. Replace `<BASE64_AUTH_STRING>` and `<YOUR_TEAM_NAME>/<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>` with your values from the previous steps:



``` bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://trace.wandb.ai/otel/v1/traces"OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Basic <BASE64_AUTH_STRING>,project_id=<YOUR_TEAM_NAME>/<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>"
```


You can then use the `experimental_telemetry` option to enable telemetry on supported AI SDK function calls:



``` typescript
import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'ai';
const result = await generateText(,  },});
```
