To use the AI SDK to send telemetry data to Traceloop, set these environment variables in your Next.js app's `.env` file:



``` bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://api.traceloop.comOTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer <Your API Key>"
```


You can then use the `experimental_telemetry` option to enable telemetry on supported AI SDK function calls:



``` typescript
import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'ai';
const result = await generateText(,  },});
```
