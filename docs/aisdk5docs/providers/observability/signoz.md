# [SigNoz Observability](#signoz-observability)


- Single tool for observability(logs, metrics, and traces)
- Correlated logs, metrics and traces for much richer context while debugging
- Uses ClickHouse (used by likes of Uber & Cloudflare) as datastore - an extremely fast and highly optimized storage for observability data
- DIY Query builder, PromQL, and ClickHouse queries to fulfill all your use-cases around querying observability data

# [Setup](#setup)

- Generate a SigNoz Ingestion Key

## [Instrument your Next.js application](#instrument-your-nextjs-application)


## [Send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud](#send-traces-directly-to-signoz-cloud)

**Step 1.** Install OpenTelemetry packages



``` bash
npm install @vercel/otel @opentelemetry/api
```


**Step 2.** Update **`next.config.mjs`** to include instrumentationHook

> This step is only needed when using NextJs 14 and below



``` jsx
/** @type  */const nextConfig = ,};export default nextConfig;
```


**Step 3.** Create **`instrumentation.ts`** file(in root project directory)



``` jsx
import  from '@vercel/otel';// Add otel loggingimport  from '@opentelemetry/api';diag.setLogger(new DiagConsoleLogger(), DiagLogLevel.ERROR); // set diaglog level to DEBUG when debuggingexport function register() ,    }),  });}
```


- **`<service_name>`** is the name of your service

> The instrumentation file should be in the root of your project and not inside the app or pages directory. If you're using the src folder, then place the file inside src alongside pages and app.

Your Next.js app should be properly instrumented now.

## [Enable Telemetry for Vercel AI SDK](#enable-telemetry-for-vercel-ai-sdk)


## [Enabling Telemetry](#enabling-telemetry)


You can then use the `experimental_telemetry` option to enable telemetry on specific function calls while the feature is experimental:



``` jsx
const result = await generateText(,});
```


When telemetry is enabled, you can also control whether you want to record the input values and the output values for the function. By default, both are enabled. You can disable them by setting the `recordInputs` and `recordOutputs` options to `false`.



``` jsx
experimental_telemetry: 
```


Disabling the recording of inputs and outputs can be useful for privacy, data transfer, and performance reasons. You might, for example, want to disable recording inputs if they contain sensitive information.

## [Telemetry Metadata](#telemetry-metadata)

You can provide a `functionId` to identify the function that the telemetry data is for, and `metadata` to include additional information in the telemetry data.



``` jsx
const result = await generateText(,  },});
```


## [Custom Tracer](#custom-tracer)

You may provide a `tracer` which must return an OpenTelemetry `Tracer`. This is useful in situations where you want your traces to use a `TracerProvider` other than the one provided by the `@opentelemetry/api` singleton.



``` jsx
const tracerProvider = new NodeTracerProvider();const result = await generateText(,});
```



Finally, you should be able to view this data in Signoz Cloud under the traces tab.
