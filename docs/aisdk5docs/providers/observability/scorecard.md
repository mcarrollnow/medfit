## [Setup](#setup)


### [NextJS](#nextjs)

To use the AI SDK to send telemetry data to Scorecard, first set these environment variables in your project:



``` bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://tracing.scorecard.io/otel/v1/tracesOTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer <Your Scorecard API Key>"
```


Next, create an `instrumentation.ts` file in your project root to initialize OpenTelemetry (You can configure it as needed):



``` typescript
import  from '@vercel/otel';
export function register() );}
```


You can then use the `experimental_telemetry` option to enable telemetry on supported AI SDK function calls:



``` typescript"
import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'ai';
const result = await generateText(,});
```
