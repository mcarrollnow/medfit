# [Sarvam Provider](#sarvam-provider)

The Sarvam AI Provider is a library developed to integrate with the AI SDK. This library brings Speech to Text (STT) capabilities to your applications, allowing for seamless interaction with audio and text data.

### [Changing parameters](#changing-parameters)

- Change language_code



``` ts
providerOptions: ,  },
```





`language_code` specifies the language of the input audio and is required for accurate transcription. • It is mandatory for the `saarika:v1` model (this model does not support `unknown`). • It is optional for the `saarika:v2` model. • Use `unknown` when the language is not known; in that case, the API will auto‑detect it. Available options: `unknown`, `hi-IN`, `bn-IN`, `kn-IN`, `ml-IN`, `mr-IN`, `od-IN`, `pa-IN`, `ta-IN`, `te-IN`, `en-IN`, `gu-IN`.



- with_timestamps?



``` ts
providerOptions: ,},
```





`with_timestamps` specifies whether to include start/end timestamps for each word/token. • Type: boolean • When true, each word/token will include start/end timestamps. • Default: false



- with_diarization?



``` ts
providerOptions: ,},
```





`with_diarization` enables speaker diarization (Beta). • Type: boolean • When true, enables speaker diarization. • Default: false



- num_speakers?



``` ts
providerOptions: ,},
```





`num_speakers` sets the number of distinct speakers to detect (only when `with_diarization` is true). • Type: number \| null • Number of distinct speakers to detect. • Default: null
