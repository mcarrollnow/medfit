# [Unofficial Community Provider for AI SDK - Inflection AI](#unofficial-community-provider-for-ai-sdk---inflection-ai)




This community provider is not yet compatible with AI SDK 5. Please wait for the provider to be updated or consider using an [AI SDK 5 compatible provider](../ai-sdk-providers.html).




## [Setup](#setup)




``` bash
npm i inflection-ai-sdk-provider
```


## [Provider Instance](#provider-instance)

You can import the default provider instance `inflection` from `inflection-ai-sdk-provider`:



``` ts
import  from 'inflection-ai-sdk-provider';
```


## [Example](#example)



``` ts
import  from 'inflection-ai-sdk-provider';import  from 'ai';
const  = await generateText();
```


## [Models](#models)

The following models are supported:

- `inflection_3_pi` - "the model powering our Pi experience, including a backstory, emotional intelligence, productivity, and safety. It excels in scenarios such as customer support chatbots."
- `inflection_3_productivity`- "the model optimized for following instructions. It is better for tasks requiring JSON output or precise adherence to provided guidelines."
- `inflection_3_with_tools` - This model seems to be in preview and it lacks an official description as of the writing of this README in 1.0.0.


| Model | Text Generation | Streaming | Image Input | Object Generation | Tool Usage | Tool Streaming |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| `inflection_3_pi` | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| `inflection_3_productivity` | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| `inflection_3_with_tools` | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |


There is limited API support for features other than text generation and streaming text at this time. Should that change, the table above will be updated and support will be added to this unofficial provider.
