# [Crosshatch Provider](#crosshatch-provider)




This community provider is not yet compatible with AI SDK 5. Please wait for the provider to be updated or consider using an [AI SDK 5 compatible provider](../ai-sdk-providers.html).




It creates language model objects that can be used with the `generateText`, `streamText`, `generateObject` and `streamObject` functions.

## [Setup](#setup)

The Crosshatch provider is available via the `@crosshatch/ai-provider` module. You can install it with:






pnpm







npm







yarn







bun








``` geist-overflow-scroll-y
pnpm add @crosshatch/ai-provider
```













### [Credentials](#credentials)

The Crosshatch provider is authenticated by user-specific tokens, enabling permissioned access to personalized inference.



## [Provider Instance](#provider-instance)

To create a Crosshatch provider instance, use the `createCrosshatch` function:



``` ts
import createCrosshatch from '@crosshatch/ai-provider';
```


## [Language Models](#language-models)




``` ts
import  from '@crosshatch/ai-provider';const crosshatch = createCrosshatch();
```


To create a model instance, call the provider instance and specify the model you would like to use in the first argument. In the second argument, specify the user auth token, desired context, and model arguments. You can use Crosshatch to get generated text based on permissioned user context and your favorite language model.

### [Example: Generate Text with Context](#example-generate-text-with-context)

This example uses `gpt-4o-mini` to generate text.



``` ts
import  from 'ai';import createCrosshatch from '@crosshatch/ai-provider':const crosshatch = createCrosshatch();
const  = await generateText(,                  ],        groupby: ["entity_name", "entity_city", "entity_region"],        orderby: "count DESC",        limit: 5      }    }  }),  system: `The user recently ate at these restaurants: `,  messages: []});
```


### [Example: Recommend Items based on Context](#example-recommend-items-based-on-context)

Use crosshatch to re-rank items based on recent user purchases.



``` ts
import  from 'ai';import createCrosshatch from `@crosshatch/ai-provider`const crosshatch = createCrosshatch();
const itemSummaries = [...]; // list of itemsconst ids = (itemSummaries?.map(() => itemId) ?? []) as string[];
const  = streamObject(],        orderBy: [],        limit: 5,      },    },  }),  system: `Rerank the following items based on alignment with users recent purchases `,  messages: [,],  schema: jsonSchema<>(,      reason: ,    },  }),})
```
