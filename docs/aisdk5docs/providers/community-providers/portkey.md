pnpm







npm







yarn







bun








``` geist-overflow-scroll-y
pnpm add @portkey-ai/vercel-provider
```












## [Provider Instance](#provider-instance)

To create a Portkey provider instance, use the `createPortkey` function:



``` typescript
import  from '@portkey-ai/vercel-provider';
const portkeyConfig = ,};
const portkey = createPortkey();
```



## [Language Models](#language-models)

Portkey supports both chat and completion models. Use `portkey.chatModel()` for chat models and `portkey.completionModel()` for completion models:



``` typescript
const chatModel = portkey.chatModel('');const completionModel = portkey.completionModel('');
```


Note: You can provide an empty string as the model name if you've defined it in the `portkeyConfig`.

## [Examples](#examples)

You can use Portkey language models with the `generateText` or `streamText` function:

### [`generateText`](#generatetext)



``` javascript
import  from '@portkey-ai/vercel-provider';import  from 'ai';
const portkey = createPortkey();
const  = await generateText();
console.log(text);
```


### [`streamText`](#streamtext)



``` javascript
import  from '@portkey-ai/vercel-provider';import  from 'ai';
const portkey = createPortkey();
const result = streamText();
for await (const chunk of result) 
```


Note:

- Portkey supports `Tool` use with the AI SDK
- `generatObject` and `streamObject` are currently not supported.
