npm







yarn







bun








``` geist-overflow-scroll-y
pnpm add @ai-sdk/vercel
```












## [Provider Instance](#provider-instance)

You can import the default provider instance `vercel` from `@ai-sdk/vercel`:



``` ts
import  from '@ai-sdk/vercel';
```


If you need a customized setup, you can import `createVercel` from `@ai-sdk/vercel` and create a provider instance with your settings:



``` ts
import  from '@ai-sdk/vercel';
const vercel = createVercel();
```


You can use the following optional settings to customize the Vercel provider instance:

- **baseURL** *string*

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls. The default prefix is `https://api.v0.dev/v1`.

- **apiKey** *string*

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header. It defaults to the `VERCEL_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **headers** *Record\<string,string\>*

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** *(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) =\> Promise\<Response\>*


## [Language Models](#language-models)

You can create language models using a provider instance. The first argument is the model ID, for example:



``` ts
import  from '@ai-sdk/vercel';import  from 'ai';
const  = await generateText();
```


Vercel language models can also be used in the `streamText` function (see [AI SDK Core](../../docs/ai-sdk-core.html)).
