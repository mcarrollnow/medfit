## [Provider Instance](#provider-instance)

const hume = createHume();
```


You can use the following optional settings to customize the Hume provider instance:

- **apiKey** *string*

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header. It defaults to the `HUME_API_KEY` environment variable.

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

```


You can also pass additional provider-specific options using the `providerOptions` argument. For example, supplying a voice to use for the generated audio.



``` ts
import  from 'ai';import  from '@ai-sdk/hume';
const result = await generateSpeech( },});
```


The following provider options are available:
