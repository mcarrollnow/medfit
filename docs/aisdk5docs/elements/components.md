# [Components](#components)

A comprehensive collection of React components designed for building modern AI chat interfaces. These components provide the essential building blocks you need to create interactive, accessible, and user-friendly conversational experiences.

## [Foundation Components](#foundation-components)

The core building blocks that form the structure of any chat interface. These components handle the fundamental aspects of displaying conversations, managing user input, and presenting AI responses in an organized, scrollable format.

**What you'll find:**

- Conversation containers that manage message flow and scrolling behavior
- Message display components with proper alignment and styling
- Input interfaces with auto-sizing and keyboard shortcuts
- Response rendering with markdown support and syntax highlighting

## [Interactive Elements](#interactive-elements)

Components that enhance user engagement and provide dynamic functionality beyond basic text exchange. These elements make conversations more intuitive and provide users with multiple ways to interact with AI systems.

**What you'll find:**

- Action buttons for common response interactions (retry, like, copy, share)
- Navigation controls for exploring different conversation branches
- Quick suggestion systems for common inputs and actions
- Collapsible interfaces for detailed tool and process information
- Interactive elements that respond to user actions and preferences

## [Content Enhancement](#content-enhancement)

Specialized components for displaying AI-generated content, metadata, and contextual information. These components help users understand how AI responses were generated and provide transparency into the reasoning process.

**What you'll find:**

- Expandable reasoning displays that show AI thought processes
- Source and citation components for research-backed responses
- Status indicators for ongoing processes and tool executions
- Rich content rendering for various data types and formats

**Responsive by Design**

- Mobile-friendly touch targets and controls
- Adaptive layouts that work across screen sizes
- Touch-optimized interactions for mobile devices
- Consistent experience across desktop and mobile

**Modern Development**

- TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- Composable architecture for flexible implementations
- Theme integration supporting light and dark modes
- Built with modern React patterns and best practices

**Performance Optimized**

- Optimized bundle sizes for fast loading
- Smooth animations and transitions

## [Building Your Interface](#building-your-interface)

These components are designed to work together seamlessly while remaining flexible enough to use independently. Whether you're building a simple chat interface or a complex conversational AI application, you can mix and match components to create the exact experience your users need.

Each component includes comprehensive documentation with examples, API references, and implementation guidance to help you integrate them into your project quickly and effectively.
