## [Why are my components not styled?](#why-are-my-components-not-styled)

Make sure your project is configured correctly for shadcn/ui in Tailwind 4 - this means having a `globals.css` file that imports Tailwind and includes the shadcn/ui base styles.

## [I ran the AI Elements CLI but nothing was added to my project](#i-ran-the-ai-elements-cli-but-nothing-was-added-to-my-project)

Double-check that:

- Your current working directory is the root of your project (where `package.json` lives).
- Your components.json file (if using shadcn-style config) is set up correctly.
- You’re using the latest version of the AI Elements CLI:



``` bash
npx ai-elements@latest
```



## [Theme switching doesn’t work — my app stays in light mode](#theme-switching-doesnt-work--my-app-stays-in-light-mode)


## [The component imports fail with “module not found”](#the-component-imports-fail-with-module-not-found)

Check the file exists. If it does, make sure your `tsconfig.json` has a proper paths alias for `@/` i.e.



``` json
  }}
```


## [My AI coding assistant can't access AI Elements components](#my-ai-coding-assistant-cant-access-ai-elements-components)

1.  Verify your config file syntax is valid JSON.
2.  Check that the file path is correct for your AI tool.
3.  Restart your coding assistant after making changes.
4.  Ensure you have a stable internet connection.
