# [Setup](#setup)

Installing AI Elements is straightforward and can be done in a couple of ways. You can use the dedicated CLI command for the fastest setup, or integrate via the standard shadcn/ui CLI if you’ve already adopted shadcn’s workflow.




ai-elements

shadcn




``` geist-overflow-scroll-y
npx ai-elements@latest
```














## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

Before installing AI Elements, make sure your environment meets the following requirements:


## [Installing Components](#installing-components)

You can install AI Elements components using either the AI Elements CLI or the shadcn/ui CLI. Both achieve the same result: adding the selected component’s code and any needed dependencies to your project.

The CLI will download the component’s code and integrate it into your project’s directory (usually under your components folder). By default, AI Elements components are added to the `@/components/ai-elements/` directory (or whatever folder you’ve configured in your shadcn components settings).

After running the command, you should see a confirmation in your terminal that the files were added. You can then proceed to use the component in your code.
