# [Model is not assignable to type "LanguageModelV1"](#model-is-not-assignable-to-type-languagemodelv1)

## [Issue](#issue)

I have updated the AI SDK and now I get the following error: `Type 'SomeModel' is not assignable to type 'LanguageModelV1'.`

Sometimes new features are being added to the model specification. This can cause incompatibilities with older provider versions.

## [Solution](#solution)

Update your provider packages and the AI SDK to the latest version.
