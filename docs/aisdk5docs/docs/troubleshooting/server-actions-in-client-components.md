# [Server Actions in Client Components](#server-actions-in-client-components)

You may use Server Actions in client components, but sometimes you may encounter the following issues.

## [Issue](#issue)

It is not allowed to define inline `"use server"` annotated Server Actions in Client Components.

## [Solution](#solution)

To use Server Actions in a Client Component, you can either:

- Export them from a separate file with `"use server"` at the top.
- Pass them down through props from a Server Component.
- Implement a combination of [`createAI`](../reference/ai-sdk-rsc/create-ai.html) and [`useActions`](../reference/ai-sdk-rsc/use-actions.html) hooks to access them.




``` ts
'use server';
import  from 'ai';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';
export async function getAnswer(question: string)  = await generateText();
  return ;}
```
