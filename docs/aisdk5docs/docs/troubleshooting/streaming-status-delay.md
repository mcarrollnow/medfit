# [Streaming Status Shows But No Text Appears](#streaming-status-shows-but-no-text-appears)

## [Issue](#issue)

When using `useChat`, the status changes to "streaming" immediately, but no text appears for several seconds.

## [Background](#background)

The status changes to "streaming" as soon as the connection to the server is established and streaming begins - this includes metadata streaming, not just the LLM's generated tokens.

## [Solution](#solution)

Create a custom loading state that checks if the last assistant message actually contains content:



``` tsx
'use client';
import  from '@ai-sdk/react';
export default function Page()  = useChat();
  const lastMessage = messages.at(-1);
  const showLoader =    status === 'streaming' &&    lastMessage?.role === 'assistant' &&    lastMessage?.parts?.length === 0;
  return (    <>      >                    ></span> : null,          )}        </div>      ))}
          </>  );}
```


You can also check for specific part types if you're waiting for something specific:



``` tsx
const showLoader =  status === 'streaming' &&  lastMessage?.role === 'assistant' &&  !lastMessage?.parts?.some(part => part.type === 'text');
```
