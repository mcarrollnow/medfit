# [Type Error with onToolCall](#type-error-with-ontoolcall)

When using the `onToolCall` callback with TypeScript, you may encounter type errors when trying to pass tool properties directly to `addToolResult`.

## [Problem](#problem)

TypeScript cannot automatically narrow the type of `toolCall.toolName` when you have both static and dynamic tools, leading to type errors:



``` tsx
// ❌ This causes a TypeScript errorconst  = useChat() );  },});
```


The error occurs because:

- Static tools have specific literal types for their names (e.g., `"getWeatherInformation"`)
- Dynamic tools have `toolName` as a generic `string`
- TypeScript can't guarantee that `toolCall.toolName` matches your specific tool names

## [Solution](#solution)

Check if the tool is dynamic first to enable proper type narrowing:



``` tsx
// ✅ Correct approach with type narrowingconst  = useChat() 
    // Now TypeScript knows this is a static tool with the correct type    addToolResult();  },});
```
