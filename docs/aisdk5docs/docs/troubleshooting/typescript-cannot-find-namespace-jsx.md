# [TypeScript error "Cannot find namespace 'JSX'"](#typescript-error-cannot-find-namespace-jsx)

## [Issue](#issue)

I am using the AI SDK in a project without React, e.g. an Hono server, and I get the following error: `error TS2503: Cannot find namespace 'JSX'.`

## [Background](#background)

The AI SDK has a dependency on `@types/react` which defines the `JSX` namespace. It will be removed in the next major version of the AI SDK.

## [Solution](#solution)

You can install the `@types/react` package as a dependency to fix the error.



``` bash
npm install @types/react
```
