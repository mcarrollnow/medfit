# [`streamText` is not working](#streamtext-is-not-working)

## [Issue](#issue)

I am using [`streamText`](../reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text.html) function, and it does not work. It does not throw any errors and the stream is only containing error parts.

## [Background](#background)

`streamText` immediately starts streaming to enable sending data without waiting for the model. Errors become part of the stream and are not thrown to prevent e.g. servers from crashing.

## [Solution](#solution)

To log errors, you can provide an `onError` callback that is triggered when an error occurs.



``` tsx
import  from 'ai';
const result = streamText() ,});
```
