# [React error "Maximum update depth exceeded"](#react-error-maximum-update-depth-exceeded)

## [Issue](#issue)

I am using the AI SDK in a React project with the `useChat` or `useCompletion` hooks and I get the following error when AI responses stream in: `Maximum update depth exceeded`.

## [Background](#background)

By default, the UI is re-rendered on every chunk that arrives. This can overload the rendering, especially on slower devices or when complex components need updating (e.g. Markdown). Throttling can mitigate this.

## [Solution](#solution)

Use the `experimental_throttle` option to throttle the UI updates:

### [`useChat`](#usechat)












``` tsx
const  = useChat()
```


### [`useCompletion`](#usecompletion)












``` tsx
const  = useCompletion()
```
