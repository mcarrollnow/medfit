# [Abort breaks resumable streams](#abort-breaks-resumable-streams)

## [Issue](#issue)

When using `useChat` with `resume: true` for stream resumption, the abort functionality breaks. Closing a tab, refreshing the page, or calling the `stop()` function will trigger an abort signal that interferes with the resumption mechanism, preventing streams from being properly resumed.



``` tsx
// This configuration will cause conflictsconst  = useChat();
// Closing the tab will trigger abort and stop resumption
```


## [Background](#background)

When a page is closed or refreshed, the browser automatically sends an abort signal, which breaks the resumption flow.

## [Current limitations](#current-limitations)

We're aware of this incompatibility and are exploring solutions. **In the meantime, please choose either stream resumption or abort functionality based on your application's requirements**, but not both.

### [Option 1: Use stream resumption without abort](#option-1-use-stream-resumption-without-abort)

If you need to support long-running generations that persist across page reloads:



``` tsx
const  = useChat();
```


### [Option 2: Use abort without stream resumption](#option-2-use-abort-without-stream-resumption)

If you need to allow users to stop streams manually:



``` tsx
const  = useChat();
```
