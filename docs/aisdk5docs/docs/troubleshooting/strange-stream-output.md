# [useChat/useCompletion stream output contains 0:... instead of text](#usechatusecompletion-stream-output-contains-0-instead-of-text)

## [Issue](#issue)

I am using custom client code to process a server response that is sent using [`StreamingTextResponse`](../reference/stream-helpers/streaming-text-response.html). I am using version `3.0.20` or newer of the AI SDK. When I send a query, the UI streams text such as `0: "Je"`, `0: " suis"`, `0: "des"...` instead of the text that I’m looking for.

## [Background](#background)

The AI SDK has switched to the stream data protocol in version `3.0.20`. It sends different stream parts to support data, tool calls, etc. What you see is the raw stream data protocol response.

## [Solution](#solution)

You have several options:

1.  Use the AI Core [`streamText`](../reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text.html) function to send a raw text stream:


    ``` tsx
    export async function POST(req: Request)  = await req.json();
      const result = streamText();
      return result.toTextStreamResponse();}
    ```


2.  Pin the AI SDK version to `3.0.19` . This will keep the raw text stream.
