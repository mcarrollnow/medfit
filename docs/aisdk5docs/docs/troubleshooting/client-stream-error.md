# ["Only plain objects can be passed from client components" Server Action Error](#only-plain-objects-can-be-passed-from-client-components-server-action-error)

## [Issue](#issue)

I am using [`streamText`](../reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text.html) or [`streamObject`](../reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-object.html) with Server Actions, and I am getting a `"only plain objects and a few built ins can be passed from client components"` error.

## [Background](#background)

This error occurs when you're trying to return a non-serializable object from a Server Action to a Client Component. The streamText function likely returns an object with methods or complex structures that can't be directly serialized and passed to the client.

## [Solution](#solution)

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that you're only returning serializable data from your Server Action. Here's how you can modify your approach:

1.  Instead of returning the entire result object from streamText, extract only the necessary serializable data.
2.  Use the [`createStreamableValue`](../reference/ai-sdk-rsc/create-streamable-value.html) function to create a streamable value that can be safely passed to the client.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to implement this solution: [Streaming Text Generation](../../cookbook/rsc/stream-text.html).

This approach ensures that only serializable data (the text) is passed to the client, avoiding the "only plain objects" error.
