# [`useChat` No Response](#usechat-no-response)

## [Issue](#issue)

I am using [`useChat`](../reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat.html). When I log the incoming messages on the server, I can see the tool call and the tool result, but the model does not respond with anything.

## [Solution](#solution)

To resolve this issue, convert the incoming messages to the `ModelMessage` format using the [`convertToModelMessages`](../reference/ai-sdk-ui/convert-to-model-messages.html) function.



``` tsx
import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'ai';
export async function POST(req: Request)  = await req.json();
  const result = streamText();
  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();}
```
