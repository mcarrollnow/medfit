# [Streaming Not Working When Proxied](#streaming-not-working-when-proxied)

## [Issue](#issue)

Streaming with the AI SDK doesn't work in local development environment, or deployed in some proxy environments. Instead of streaming, only the full response is returned after a while.

## [Cause](#cause)

The causes of this issue are caused by the proxy middleware.

If the middleware is configured to compress the response, it will cause the streaming to fail.

## [Solution](#solution)

You can try the following, the solution only affects the streaming API:

- add `'Content-Encoding': 'none'` headers


  ``` tsx
  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse(,});
  ```
