# [Client-Side Function Calls Not Invoked](#client-side-function-calls-not-invoked)

## [Issue](#issue)

I upgraded the AI SDK to v3.0.20 or newer. I am using [`OpenAIStream`](../reference/stream-helpers/openai-stream.html). Client-side function calls are no longer invoked.

## [Solution](#solution)

You will need to add a stub for `experimental_onFunctionCall` to [`OpenAIStream`](../reference/stream-helpers/openai-stream.html) to enable the correct forwarding of the function calls to the client.



``` tsx
const stream = OpenAIStream(response, ,});
```
