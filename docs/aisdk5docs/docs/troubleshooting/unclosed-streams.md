# [Unclosed Streams](#unclosed-streams)

Sometimes streams are not closed properly, which can lead to unexpected behavior. The following are some common issues that can occur when streams are not closed properly.

## [Issue](#issue)

The streamable UI has been slow to update.

## [Solution](#solution)

This happens when you create a streamable UI using [`createStreamableUI`](../reference/ai-sdk-rsc/create-streamable-ui.html) and fail to close the stream. In order to fix this, you must ensure you close the stream by calling the [`.done()`](../reference/ai-sdk-rsc/create-streamable-ui.html#done) method. This will ensure the stream is closed.



``` tsx
import  from '@ai-sdk/rsc';
const submitMessage = async () => ;
```
