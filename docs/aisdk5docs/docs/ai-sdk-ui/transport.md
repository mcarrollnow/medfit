# [Transport](#transport)

The `useChat` transport system provides fine-grained control over how messages are sent to your API endpoints and how responses are processed. This is particularly useful for alternative communication protocols like WebSockets, custom authentication patterns, or specialized backend integrations.

## [Default Transport](#default-transport)

By default, `useChat` uses HTTP POST requests to send messages to `/api/chat`:



``` tsx
import  from '@ai-sdk/react';
// Uses default HTTP transportconst  = useChat();
```


This is equivalent to:



``` tsx
import  from '@ai-sdk/react';import  from 'ai';
const  = useChat(),});
```


## [Custom Transport Configuration](#custom-transport-configuration)

Configure the default transport with custom options:



``` tsx
import  from '@ai-sdk/react';import  from 'ai';
const  = useChat(,    credentials: 'include',  }),});
```


### [Dynamic Configuration](#dynamic-configuration)

You can also provide functions that return configuration values. This is useful for authentication tokens that need to be refreshed, or for configuration that depends on runtime conditions:



``` tsx
const  = useChat(`,      'X-User-ID': getCurrentUserId(),    }),    body: () => (),    credentials: () => 'include',  }),});
```


### [Request Transformation](#request-transformation)

Transform requests before sending to your API:



``` tsx
const  = useChat() => ,        body: ,      };    },  }),});
```


## [Building Custom Transports](#building-custom-transports)

To understand how to build your own transport, refer to the source code of the default implementation:


These implementations show you exactly how to:

- Handle the `sendMessages` method
- Process UI message streams
- Transform requests and responses
- Handle errors and connection management

The transport system gives you complete control over how your chat application communicates, enabling integration with any backend protocol or service.
