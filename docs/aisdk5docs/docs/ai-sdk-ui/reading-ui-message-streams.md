# [Reading UI Message Streams](#reading-ui-message-streams)

`UIMessage` streams are useful outside of traditional chat use cases. You can consume them for terminal UIs, custom stream processing on the client, or React Server Components (RSC).

The `readUIMessageStream` helper transforms a stream of `UIMessageChunk` objects into an `AsyncIterableStream` of `UIMessage` objects, allowing you to process messages as they're being constructed.

## [Basic Usage](#basic-usage)



``` tsx
import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'ai';
async function main() );
  for await (const uiMessage of readUIMessageStream()) }
```


## [Tool Calls Integration](#tool-calls-integration)

Handle streaming responses that include tool calls:



``` tsx
import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'ai';import  from 'zod';
async function handleToolCalls() ),        execute: () => (),      }),    },    prompt: 'What is the weather in Tokyo?',  });
  for await (const uiMessage of readUIMessageStream())     });  }}
```


## [Resuming Conversations](#resuming-conversations)

Resume streaming from a previous message state:



``` tsx
import  from 'ai';
async function resumeConversation(lastMessage: UIMessage) ,    ],  });
  // Resume from the last message  for await (const uiMessage of readUIMessageStream()) }
```
