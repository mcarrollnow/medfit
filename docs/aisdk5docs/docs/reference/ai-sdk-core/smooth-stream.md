# [`smoothStream()`](#smoothstream)

`smoothStream` is a utility function that creates a TransformStream for the `streamText` `transform` option to smooth out text streaming by buffering and releasing complete words with configurable delays. This creates a more natural reading experience when streaming text responses.



``` ts
import  from 'ai';
const result = streamText(),});
```


## [Import](#import)



``` geist-overflow-scroll-y
import  from "ai"
```










## [API Signature](#api-signature)

### [Parameters](#parameters)






### delayInMs?:


number \| null




The delay in milliseconds between outputting each chunk. Defaults to 10ms. Set to \`null\` to disable delays.





### chunking?:


"word" \| "line" \| RegExp \| (buffer: string) =\> string \| undefined \| null




Controls how the text is chunked for streaming. Use "word" to stream word by word (default), "line" to stream line by line, or provide a custom callback or RegExp pattern for custom chunking.






#### [Word chunking caveats with non-latin languages](#word-chunking-caveats-with-non-latin-languages)

The word based chunking **does not work well** with the following languages that do not delimit words with spaces:

For these languages we recommend using a custom regex, like the following:

- Chinese - `/[\u4E00-\u9FFF]|\S+\s+/`
- Japanese - `/[\u3040-\u309F\u30A0-\u30FF]|\S+\s+/`












``` tsx
import  from 'ai';
const result = streamText(),});
```













``` tsx
import  from 'ai';
const result = streamText(),});
```


For these languages you could pass your own language aware chunking function:

- Vietnamese
- Thai
- Javanese (Aksara Jawa)

#### [Regex based chunking](#regex-based-chunking)

To use regex based chunking, pass a `RegExp` to the `chunking` option.



``` ts
// To split on underscores:smoothStream();
// Also can do it like this, same behaviorsmoothStream();
```


#### [Custom callback chunking](#custom-callback-chunking)

To use a custom callback for chunking, pass a function to the `chunking` option.



``` ts
smoothStream(
    return text.slice(0, index) + findString;  },});
```


### [Returns](#returns)

Returns a `TransformStream` that:

- Buffers incoming text chunks
- Releases text when the chunking pattern is encountered
- Adds configurable delays between chunks for smooth output
- Passes through non-text chunks (like step-finish events) immediately
