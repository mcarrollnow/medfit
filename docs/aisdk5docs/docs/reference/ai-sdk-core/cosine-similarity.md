# [`cosineSimilarity()`](#cosinesimilarity)

When you want to compare the similarity of embeddings, standard vector similarity metrics like cosine similarity are often used.

`cosineSimilarity` calculates the cosine similarity between two vectors. A high value (close to 1) indicates that the vectors are very similar, while a low value (close to -1) indicates that they are different.



``` ts
import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'ai';
const  = await embedMany();
console.log(  `cosine similarity: $`,);
```
