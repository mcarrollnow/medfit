# [`dynamicTool()`](#dynamictool)

The `dynamicTool` function creates tools where the input and output types are not known at compile time. This is useful for scenarios such as:

- MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools without schemas
- User-defined functions loaded at runtime
- Tools loaded from external sources or databases
- Dynamic tool generation based on user input

Unlike the regular `tool` function, `dynamicTool` accepts and returns `unknown` types, allowing you to work with tools that have runtime-determined schemas.



``` ts
import  from 'ai';import  from 'zod';
export const customTool = dynamicTool(),  // input is typed as 'unknown'  execute: async input =>  = input as any;
    // Execute your dynamic logic    return  with $`,    };  },});
```


## [Import](#import)



``` geist-overflow-scroll-y
import  from "ai"
```










## [API Signature](#api-signature)

### [Parameters](#parameters)






### tool:


Object




The dynamic tool definition.




Object




### description?:


string




Information about the purpose of the tool including details on how and when it can be used by the model.





### inputSchema:


FlexibleSchema\<unknown\>




The schema of the input that the tool expects. While the type is unknown, a schema is still required for validation. You can use Zod schemas with z.unknown() or z.any() for fully dynamic inputs.





### execute:


ToolExecuteFunction\<unknown, unknown\>




An async function that is called with the arguments from the tool call. The input is typed as unknown and must be validated/cast at runtime.




ToolCallOptions




### toolCallId:


string




The ID of the tool call.





### messages:


ModelMessage\[\]




Messages that were sent to the language model.





### abortSignal?:


AbortSignal




An optional abort signal.







### toModelOutput?:


(output: unknown) =\> LanguageModelV2ToolResultPart\['output'\]




Optional conversion function that maps the tool result to an output that can be used by the language model.





### providerOptions?:


ProviderOptions




Additional provider-specific metadata.








### [Returns](#returns)

A `Tool<unknown, unknown>` with `type: 'dynamic'` that can be used with `generateText`, `streamText`, and other AI SDK functions.

## [Type-Safe Usage](#type-safe-usage)

When using dynamic tools alongside static tools, you need to check the `dynamic` flag for proper type narrowing:



``` ts
const result = await generateText(),  },  onStepFinish: () => 
      // Static tools have full type inference      switch (toolCall.toolName)     }  },});
```


## [Usage with `useChat`](#usage-with-usechat)

When used with useChat (`UIMessage` format), dynamic tools appear as `dynamic-tool` parts:



``` tsx
</h4>            <pre></pre>          </div>        );      // ... handle other part types    }  });}
```
