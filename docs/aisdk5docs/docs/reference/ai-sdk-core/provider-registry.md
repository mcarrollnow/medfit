# [`createProviderRegistry()`](#createproviderregistry)

When you work with multiple providers and models, it is often desirable to manage them in a central place and access the models through simple string ids.

`createProviderRegistry` lets you create a registry with multiple providers that you can access by their ids in the format `providerId:modelId`.

### [Setup](#setup)

You can create a registry with multiple providers and models using `createProviderRegistry`.



``` ts
import  from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'ai';
export const registry = createProviderRegistry(),});
```


### [Custom Separator](#custom-separator)

By default, the registry uses `:` as the separator between provider and model IDs. You can customize this separator by passing a `separator` option:



``` ts
const registry = createProviderRegistry(  ,  ,);
// Now you can use the custom separatorconst model = registry.languageModel('anthropic > claude-3-opus-20240229');
```


### [Language models](#language-models)

You can access language models by using the `languageModel` method on the registry. The provider id will become the prefix of the model id: `providerId:modelId`.



``` ts
import  from 'ai';import  from './registry';
const  = await generateText();
```


### [Text embedding models](#text-embedding-models)

You can access text embedding models by using the `textEmbeddingModel` method on the registry. The provider id will become the prefix of the model id: `providerId:modelId`.



``` ts
import  from 'ai';import  from './registry';
const  = await embed();
```


### [Image models](#image-models)

You can access image models by using the `imageModel` method on the registry. The provider id will become the prefix of the model id: `providerId:modelId`.



``` ts
import  from 'ai';import  from './registry';
const  = await generateImage();
```


## [Import](#import)



``` geist-overflow-scroll-y
import  from "ai"
```










## [API Signature](#api-signature)

### [Parameters](#parameters)






### providers:


Record\<string, Provider\>




The unique identifier for the provider. It should be unique within the registry.




Provider




### languageModel:


(id: string) =\> LanguageModel




A function that returns a language model by its id.





### textEmbeddingModel:


(id: string) =\> EmbeddingModel\<string\>




A function that returns a text embedding model by its id.





### imageModel:


(id: string) =\> ImageModel




A function that returns an image model by its id.







### options:


object




Optional configuration for the registry.




Options




### separator:


string




Custom separator between provider and model IDs. Defaults to ":".








### [Returns](#returns)

The `createProviderRegistry` function returns a `Provider` instance. It has the following methods:






### languageModel:


(id: string) =\> LanguageModel




A function that returns a language model by its id (format: providerId:modelId)





### textEmbeddingModel:


(id: string) =\> EmbeddingModel\<string\>




A function that returns a text embedding model by its id (format: providerId:modelId)





### imageModel:


(id: string) =\> ImageModel




A function that returns an image model by its id (format: providerId:modelId)
