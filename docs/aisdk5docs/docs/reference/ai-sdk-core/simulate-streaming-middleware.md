# [`simulateStreamingMiddleware()`](#simulatestreamingmiddleware)

`simulateStreamingMiddleware` is a middleware function that simulates streaming behavior with responses from non-streaming language models. This is useful when you want to maintain a consistent streaming interface even when using models that only provide complete responses.



``` ts
import  from 'ai';
const middleware = simulateStreamingMiddleware();
```


## [Import](#import)



``` geist-overflow-scroll-y
import  from "ai"
```










## [API Signature](#api-signature)

### [Parameters](#parameters)

This middleware doesn't accept any parameters.

### [Returns](#returns)

Returns a middleware object that:

- Takes a complete response from a language model
- Converts it into a simulated stream of chunks
- Properly handles various response components including:
  - Text content
  - Reasoning (as string or array of objects)
  - Tool calls
  - Metadata and usage information
  - Warnings

### [Usage Example](#usage-example)



``` ts
import  from 'ai';import  from 'ai';import  from 'ai';
// Example with a non-streaming modelconst result = streamText(),  prompt: 'Your prompt here',});
// Now you can use the streaming interfacefor await (const chunk of result.fullStream) 
```


## [How It Works](#how-it-works)

The middleware:

1.  Awaits the complete response from the language model
2.  Creates a `ReadableStream` that emits chunks in the correct sequence
3.  Simulates streaming by breaking down the response into appropriate chunk types
4.  Preserves all metadata, reasoning, tool calls, and other response properties
