# [`simulateReadableStream()`](#simulatereadablestream)

`simulateReadableStream` is a utility function that creates a ReadableStream which emits provided values sequentially with configurable delays. This is particularly useful for testing streaming functionality or simulating time-delayed data streams.



``` ts
import  from 'ai';
const stream = simulateReadableStream();
```


## [Import](#import)



``` geist-overflow-scroll-y
import  from "ai"
```










## [API Signature](#api-signature)

### [Parameters](#parameters)






### chunks:


T\[\]




Array of values to be emitted by the stream





### initialDelayInMs?:


number \| null




Initial delay in milliseconds before emitting the first value. Defaults to 0. Set to null to skip the initial delay entirely.





### chunkDelayInMs?:


number \| null




Delay in milliseconds between emitting each value. Defaults to 0. Set to null to skip delays between chunks.






### [Returns](#returns)

Returns a `ReadableStream<T>` that:

- Emits each value from the provided `chunks` array sequentially
- Waits for `initialDelayInMs` before emitting the first value (if not `null`)
- Waits for `chunkDelayInMs` between emitting subsequent values (if not `null`)
- Closes automatically after all chunks have been emitted

### [Type Parameters](#type-parameters)

- `T`: The type of values contained in the chunks array and emitted by the stream

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Basic Usage](#basic-usage)



``` ts
const stream = simulateReadableStream();
```


### [With Delays](#with-delays)



``` ts
const stream = simulateReadableStream();
```


### [Without Delays](#without-delays)



``` ts
const stream = simulateReadableStream();
```
