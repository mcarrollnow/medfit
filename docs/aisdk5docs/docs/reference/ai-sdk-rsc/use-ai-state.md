# [`useAIState`](#useaistate)




AI SDK RSC is currently experimental. We recommend using [AI SDK UI](../../ai-sdk-ui/overview.html) for production. For guidance on migrating from RSC to UI, see our [migration guide](../../ai-sdk-rsc/migrating-to-ui.html).



It is a hook that enables you to read and update the AI state. The AI state is shared globally between all `useAIState` hooks under the same `<AI/>` provider.

The AI state is intended to contain context and information shared with the AI model, such as system messages, function responses, and other relevant data.

## [Import](#import)



``` geist-overflow-scroll-y
import  from "@ai-sdk/rsc"
```










## [API Signature](#api-signature)

### [Returns](#returns)

A single element array where the first element is the current AI state.
