# [`useStreamableValue`](#usestreamablevalue)




AI SDK RSC is currently experimental. We recommend using [AI SDK UI](../../ai-sdk-ui/overview.html) for production. For guidance on migrating from RSC to UI, see our [migration guide](../../ai-sdk-rsc/migrating-to-ui.html).



It is a React hook that takes a streamable value created using [`createStreamableValue`](create-streamable-value.html) and returns the current value, error, and pending state.

## [Import](#import)



``` geist-overflow-scroll-y
import  from "@ai-sdk/rsc"

## [Example](#example)

This is useful for consuming streamable values received from a component's props.



``` tsx
function MyComponent() </div>;
  return <div>Data: </div>;}
```


## [API Signature](#api-signature)

### [Parameters](#parameters)

It accepts a streamable value created using `createStreamableValue`.

### [Returns](#returns)

It is an array, where the first element contains the data, the second element contains an error if it is thrown anytime during the stream, and the third is a boolean indicating if the value is pending.
