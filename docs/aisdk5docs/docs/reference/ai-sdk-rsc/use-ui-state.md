# [`useUIState`](#useuistate)




AI SDK RSC is currently experimental. We recommend using [AI SDK UI](../../ai-sdk-ui/overview.html) for production. For guidance on migrating from RSC to UI, see our [migration guide](../../ai-sdk-rsc/migrating-to-ui.html).



It is a hook that enables you to read and update the UI State. The state is client-side and can contain functions, React nodes, and other data. UIState is the visual representation of the AI state.

## [Import](#import)



``` geist-overflow-scroll-y
import  from "@ai-sdk/rsc"
```










## [API Signature](#api-signature)

### [Returns](#returns)

Similar to useState, it is an array, where the first element is the current UI state and the second element is the function that updates the state.

## [Examples](#examples)
