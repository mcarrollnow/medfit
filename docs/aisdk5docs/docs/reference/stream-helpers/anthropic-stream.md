# [`AnthropicStream`](#anthropicstream)









AnthropicStream is part of the legacy Anthropic integration. It is not compatible with the AI SDK 3.1 functions. It is recommended to use the [AI SDK Anthropic Provider](../../../providers/ai-sdk-providers/anthropic.html) instead.



It is a utility function that transforms the output from Anthropic's SDK into a ReadableStream. It uses AIStream under the hood, applying a specific parser for the Anthropic's response data structure.
