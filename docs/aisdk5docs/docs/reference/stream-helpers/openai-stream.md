# [`OpenAIStream`](#openaistream)









OpenAIStream is part of the legacy OpenAI integration. It is not compatible with the AI SDK 3.1 functions. It is recommended to use the [AI SDK OpenAI Provider](../../../providers/ai-sdk-providers/openai.html) instead.



Transforms the response from OpenAI's language models into a ReadableStream.

Note: Prior to v4, the official OpenAI API SDK does not support the Edge Runtime and only works in serverless environments. The openai-edge package is based on fetch instead of axios (and thus works in the Edge Runtime) so we recommend using openai v4+ or openai-edge.
