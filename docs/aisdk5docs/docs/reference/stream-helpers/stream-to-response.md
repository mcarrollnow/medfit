# [`streamToResponse`](#streamtoresponse)




`streamToResponse` has been removed in AI SDK 4.0. Use `pipeDataStreamToResponse` from [streamText](../ai-sdk-core/stream-text.html) instead.



`streamToResponse` pipes a data stream to a Node.js `ServerResponse` object and sets the status code and headers.

This is useful to create data stream responses in environments that use `ServerResponse` objects, such as Node.js HTTP servers.

The status code and headers can be configured using the `options` parameter. By default, the status code is set to 200 and the Content-Type header is set to `text/plain; charset=utf-8`.

## [Import](#import)



``` geist-overflow-scroll-y
import  from "ai"
```










## [Example](#example)

You can e.g. use `streamToResponse` to pipe a data stream to a Node.js HTTP server response:



``` ts
import  from '@ai-sdk/openai';import  from 'ai';import  from 'http';
createServer(async (req, res) => );
  // use stream data  const data = new StreamData();
  data.append('initialized call');
  streamToResponse(    result.toAIStream(,    }),    res,    ,    data,  );}).listen(8080);
```
