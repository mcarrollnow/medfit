# [AI_NoObjectGeneratedError](#ai_noobjectgeneratederror)

This error occurs when the AI provider fails to generate a parsable object that conforms to the schema. It can arise due to the following reasons:

- The model failed to generate a response.
- The model generated a response that could not be parsed.
- The model generated a response that could not be validated against the schema.

## [Properties](#properties)

- `message`: The error message.
- `text`: The text that was generated by the model. This can be the raw text or the tool call text, depending on the object generation mode.
- `response`: Metadata about the language model response, including response id, timestamp, and model.
- `usage`: Request token usage.
- `finishReason`: Request finish reason. For example 'length' if model generated maximum number of tokens, this could result in a JSON parsing error.
- `cause`: The cause of the error (e.g. a JSON parsing error). You can use this for more detailed error handling.

## [Checking for this Error](#checking-for-this-error)

You can check if an error is an instance of `AI_NoObjectGeneratedError` using:



``` typescript

```
