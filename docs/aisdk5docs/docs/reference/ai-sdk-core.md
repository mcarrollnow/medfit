# [AI SDK Core](#ai-sdk-core)

[AI SDK Core](../ai-sdk-core.html) is a set of functions that allow you to interact with language models and other AI models. These functions are designed to be easy-to-use and flexible, allowing you to generate text, structured data, and embeddings from language models and other AI models.

AI SDK Core contains the following main functions:




generateText()



Generate text and call tools from a language model.




streamText()



Stream text and call tools from a language model.




generateObject()



Generate structured data from a language model.




streamObject()



Stream structured data from a language model.




embed()



Generate an embedding for a single value using an embedding model.




embedMany()



Generate embeddings for several values using an embedding model (batch embedding).




experimental_generateImage()



Generate images based on a given prompt using an image model.




experimental_transcribe()



Generate a transcript from an audio file.




experimental_generateSpeech()



Generate speech audio from text.



It also contains the following helper functions:




tool()



Type inference helper function for tools.




experimental_createMCPClient()



Creates a client for connecting to MCP servers.




jsonSchema()



Creates AI SDK compatible JSON schema objects.




zodSchema()



Creates AI SDK compatible Zod schema objects.




createProviderRegistry()



Creates a registry for using models from multiple providers.




cosineSimilarity()



Calculates the cosine similarity between two vectors, e.g. embeddings.




simulateReadableStream()



Creates a ReadableStream that emits values with configurable delays.




wrapLanguageModel()



Wraps a language model with middleware.




extractReasoningMiddleware()



Extracts reasoning from the generated text and exposes it as a \`reasoning\` property on the result.




simulateStreamingMiddleware()



Simulates streaming behavior with responses from non-streaming language models.




defaultSettingsMiddleware()



Applies default settings to a language model.




smoothStream()



Smooths text streaming output.




generateId()



Helper function for generating unique IDs




createIdGenerator()



Creates an ID generator
