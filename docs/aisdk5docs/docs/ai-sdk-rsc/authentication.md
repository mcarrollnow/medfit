# [Authentication](#authentication)




AI SDK RSC is currently experimental. We recommend using [AI SDK UI](../ai-sdk-ui/overview.html) for production. For guidance on migrating from RSC to UI, see our [migration guide](migrating-to-ui.html).




Server Actions are exposed as public, unprotected endpoints. As a result, you should treat Server Actions as you would public-facing API endpoints and ensure that the user is authorized to perform the action before returning any data.












``` tsx
'use server';
import  from 'next/headers';import  from '@ai-sdk/rsc';import  from '../utils/auth';
export const getWeather = async () => ;  }  const streamableDisplay = createStreamableUI(null);
  streamableDisplay.update(<Skeleton />);  streamableDisplay.done(<Weather />);
  return ;};
```
