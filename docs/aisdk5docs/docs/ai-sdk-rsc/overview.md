# [AI SDK RSC](#ai-sdk-rsc)




AI SDK RSC is currently experimental. We recommend using [AI SDK UI](../ai-sdk-ui/overview.html) for production. For guidance on migrating from RSC to UI, see our [migration guide](migrating-to-ui.html).






The `@ai-sdk/rsc` package is compatible with frameworks that support React Server Components.




## [AI SDK RSC Functions](#ai-sdk-rsc-functions)

AI SDK RSC has various functions designed to help you build AI-native applications with React Server Components. These functions:

1.  Provide abstractions for building Generative UI applications.
    - [`streamUI`](../reference/ai-sdk-rsc/stream-ui.html): calls a model and allows it to respond with React Server Components.
    - [`useUIState`](../reference/ai-sdk-rsc/use-ui-state.html): returns the current UI state and a function to update the UI State (like React's `useState`). UI State is the visual representation of the AI state.
    - [`useAIState`](../reference/ai-sdk-rsc/use-ai-state.html): returns the current AI state and a function to update the AI State (like React's `useState`). The AI state is intended to contain context and information shared with the AI model, such as system messages, function responses, and other relevant data.
    - [`useActions`](../reference/ai-sdk-rsc/use-actions.html): provides access to your Server Actions from the client. This is particularly useful for building interfaces that require user interactions with the server.
    - [`createAI`](../reference/ai-sdk-rsc/create-ai.html): creates a client-server context provider that can be used to wrap parts of your application tree to easily manage both UI and AI states of your application.
2.  Make it simple to work with streamable values between the server and client.
    - [`createStreamableValue`](../reference/ai-sdk-rsc/create-streamable-value.html): creates a stream that sends values from the server to the client. The value can be any serializable data.
    - [`readStreamableValue`](../reference/ai-sdk-rsc/read-streamable-value.html): reads a streamable value from the client that was originally created using `createStreamableValue`.
    - [`createStreamableUI`](../reference/ai-sdk-rsc/create-streamable-ui.html): creates a stream that sends UI from the server to the client.
    - [`useStreamableValue`](../reference/ai-sdk-rsc/use-streamable-value.html): accepts a streamable value created using `createStreamableValue` and returns the current value, error, and pending state.
