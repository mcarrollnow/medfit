# [Multiple Streams](#multiple-streams)

## [Multiple Streamable UIs](#multiple-streamable-uis)

The AI SDK RSC APIs allow you to compose and return any number of streamable UIs, along with other data, in a single request. This can be useful when you want to decouple the UI into smaller components and stream them separately.



``` tsx
'use server';
import  from '@ai-sdk/rsc';
export async function getWeather() </div>);  });
  getForecastData().then(forecastData => </div>);  });
  // Return both streamable UIs and other data fields.  return ;}
```


The client side code is similar to the previous example, but the [tool call](../ai-sdk-core/tools-and-tool-calling.html) will return the new data structure with the weather and forecast UIs. Depending on the speed of getting weather and forecast data, these two components might be updated independently.

## [Nested Streamable UIs](#nested-streamable-uis)

You can stream UI components within other UI components. This allows you to create complex UIs that are built up from smaller, reusable components. In the example below, we pass a `historyChart` streamable as a prop to a `StockCard` component. The StockCard can render the `historyChart` streamable, and it will automatically update as the server responds with new data.



``` tsx
async function getStockHistoryChart() );
    // Show a spinner as the history chart for now.    const historyChart = createStreamableUI(<Spinner />);    ui.done(<StockCard historyChart= price= />);
  return ui;}
```
