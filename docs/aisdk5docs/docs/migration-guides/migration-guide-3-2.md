# [Migrate AI SDK 3.1 to 3.2](#migrate-ai-sdk-31-to-32)







This guide will help you upgrade to AI SDK 3.2:

- Experimental `StreamingReactResponse` functionality has been removed
- Several features have been deprecated
- UI framework integrations have moved to their own Node modules

## [Upgrading](#upgrading)

### [AI SDK](#ai-sdk)

To update to AI SDK version 3.2, run the following command using your preferred package manager:



``` geist-overflow-scroll-y
pnpm add ai@latest
```










## [Removed Functionality](#removed-functionality)

The experimental `StreamingReactResponse` has been removed. You can use [AI SDK RSC](../ai-sdk-rsc/overview.html) to build streaming UIs.

## [Deprecated Functionality](#deprecated-functionality)

The `nanoid` export has been deprecated. Please use [`generateId`](../reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-id.html) instead.

## [UI Package Separation](#ui-package-separation)


The integrations (other than React and RSC) have moved to separate Node modules. You need to update the import and require statements as follows:

- Change `ai/svelte` to `@ai-sdk/svelte`
- Change `ai/vue` to `@ai-sdk/vue`
- Change `ai/solid` to `@ai-sdk/solid`

The old exports are still available but will be removed in a future release.
