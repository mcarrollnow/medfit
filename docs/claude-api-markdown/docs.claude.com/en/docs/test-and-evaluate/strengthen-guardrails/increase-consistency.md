Here’s how to make Claude’s responses more consistent:

## 

[​

](#specify-the-desired-output-format)

Specify the desired output format

Precisely define your desired output format using JSON, XML, or custom templates so that Claude understands every output formatting element you require.

Example: Standardizing customer feedback

| Role | Content |
| --- | --- |
| User | You’re a Customer Insights AI. Analyze this feedback and output in JSON format with keys: “sentiment” (positive/negative/neutral), “key\_issues” (list), and “action\_items” (list of dicts with “team” and “task”).  
  
”I’ve been a loyal user for 3 years, but the recent UI update is a disaster. Finding basic features is now a scavenger hunt. Plus, the new ‘premium’ pricing is outrageous. I’m considering switching unless this is fixed ASAP.” |
| Assistant | {  
“sentiment”: “negative”,  
“key\_issues”: \[  
“Poor UI/UX in recent update”,  
“Difficulty finding basic features”,  
“Perceived high pricing (new ‘premium’ tier)”  
\],  
“action\_items”: \[  
{  
“team”: “Product”,  
“task”: “Conduct usability testing and iterate on UI based on findings”  
},  
{  
“team”: “UX”,  
“task”: “Create a feature discovery guide or onboarding flow”  
},  
{  
“team”: “Marketing”,  
“task”: “Review pricing strategy and communicate value proposition”  
},  
{  
“team”: “Customer Success”,  
“task”: “Reach out to user, offer concessions to prevent churn”  
}  
\]  
} |

## 

[​

](#prefill-claude%E2%80%99s-response)

Prefill Claude’s response

Prefill the `Assistant` turn with your desired format. This trick bypasses Claude’s friendly preamble and enforces your structure.

Example: Daily sales report

| Role | Content |
| --- | --- |
| User | You’re an insightful Sales Intelligence AI. Generate today’s sales report.  
  
Structure the report like this:

](#constrain-with-examples)

Constrain with examples

Provide examples of your desired output. This trains Claude’s understanding better than abstract instructions.

Example: Generating consistent market intelligence

| Role | Content |
| --- | --- |
| User | As a Market Intelligence AI, your task is to analyze data about our competitors. Here is our competitor data:  
<data>  
{{DATA}}  
</data>  
  
Output following this example format:

<opportunities>- Bullet points</opportunities>  
<threats>- Bullet points</threats>

](#use-retrieval-for-contextual-consistency)

Use retrieval for contextual consistency

For tasks requiring consistent context (e.g., chatbots, knowledge bases), use retrieval to ground Claude’s responses in a fixed information set.

Example: Enhancing IT support consistency

| Role | Content |
| --- | --- |
| User | You’re our IT Support AI that draws on knowledge base data. Here are entries from your knowledge base:  
  
<kb>  
<entry>  
<id>1</id>  
<title>Reset Active Directory password</title>  
<content>1. Go to password.ourcompany.com  
2\. Enter your username  
3\. Click “Forgot Password”  
4\. Follow email instructions</content>  
</entry>  
<entry>  
<id>2</id>  
<title>Connect to VPN</title>  
<content>1. Install GlobalProtect from software center  
2\. Open GlobalProtect, enter “vpn.ourcompany.com”  
3\. Use AD credentials to log in</content>  
</entry>  
</kb>  
  
When helping users, always check the knowledge base first. Respond in this format:  
  
<response>  
<kb\_entry>Knowledge base entry used</kb\_entry>  
<answer>Your response</answer>  
</response> Write some test questions for yourself and answer them using the knowledge base, just to make sure you understand how to use the knowledge base properly. |
| Assistant | Understood. I’ll use the knowledge base for consistent responses. Let’s test with a couple of scenarios.  
  
User: Hey, I can’t log into my email. I think I forgot my password.  
  
<response>  
<kb\_entry>1: Reset Active Directory password</entry>  
<answer>I understand you’re having trouble logging into your email due to a forgotten password. No worries, this is a common issue. To reset your Active Directory password, which is used for email access, follow these steps:  
  
1\. Go to password.ourcompany.com  
2\. Enter your username (same as your email address)  
3\. Click on the “Forgot Password” link  
4\. You’ll receive an email with instructions. Follow them to reset your password.  
  
After resetting, you should be able to log into your email. Let me know if you need any further assistance.</answer>  
</response>  
  
User: I’m working from home today. How do I access internal resources?  
  
<response>  
<kb\_entry>2: Connect to VPN</entry>  
<answer>Great question! To access internal resources while working from home, you’ll need to connect to our company VPN (Virtual Private Network). Here’s how to set that up:  
  
1\. First, install the GlobalProtect VPN client. You can find this in our software center.  
2\. Once installed, open the GlobalProtect application.  
3\. In the server field, enter “vpn.ourcompany.com”.  
4\. Use your Active Directory (AD) credentials to log in - the same username and password you use for your email.  
  
Once connected, you’ll have secure access to all internal resources as if you were in the office. Let me know if you run into any issues during setup.</answer>

Chain prompts for complex tasks

Break down complex tasks into smaller, consistent subtasks. Each subtask gets Claude’s full attention, reducing inconsistency errors across scaled workflows.
