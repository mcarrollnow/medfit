# Building with Claude

Copy page

Claude is a family of [highly performant and intelligent AI models](about-claude/models/overview.html) built by Anthropic. While Claude is powerful and extensible, it’s also the most trustworthy and reliable AI available. It follows critical protocols, makes fewer mistakes, and is resistant to jailbreaks—allowing [enterprise customers](https://claude.com/customers) to build the safest AI-powered applications at scale.

Copy page

This guide introduces Claude’s enterprise capabilities, the end-to-end flow for developing with Claude, and how to start building.

](#what-you-can-do-with-claude)

What you can do with Claude

Claude is designed to empower enterprises at scale with strong performance across benchmark evaluations for reasoning, math, coding, and fluency in English and non-English languages. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of Claude’s capabilities and common uses.

| Capability | Enables you to… |
| --- | --- |
| Text and code generation | 
-   Adhere to brand voice for excellent customer-facing experiences such as copywriting and chatbots
-   Create production-level code and operate (in-line code generation, debugging, and conversational querying) within complex codebases
-   Build automatic translation features between languages
-   Conduct complex financial forecasts
-   Support legal use cases that require high-quality technical analysis, long context windows for processing detailed documents, and fast outputs

 |
| Vision | 

-   Process and analyze visual input, such as extracting insights from charts and graphs
-   Generate code from images with code snippets or templates based on diagrams
-   Describe an image for a user with low vision

 |
| Tool use | 

-   Interact with external client-side tools and functions, allowing Claude to reason, plan, and execute actions by generating structured outputs through API calls

 |

](#enterprise-considerations)

Enterprise considerations

Along with an extensive set of features, tools, and capabilities, Claude is also built to be secure, trustworthy, and scalable for wide-reaching enterprise needs.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Secure** | 
-   [Enterprise-grade](https://trust.anthropic.com/) security and data handling for API
-   SOC II Type 2 certified, HIPAA compliance options for API
-   Accessible through AWS (GA) and GCP (in private preview)

 |
| **Trustworthy** | 

-   Resistant to jailbreaks and misuse. We continuously monitor prompts and outputs for harmful, malicious use cases that violate our [AUP](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup).
-   Copyright indemnity protections for paid commercial services
-   Uniquely positioned to serve high trust industries that process large volumes of sensitive user data

 |
| **Capable** | 

-   200K token context window for expanded use cases, with future support for 1M
-   [Tool use](agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview.html), also known as function calling, which allows seamless integration of Claude into specialized applications and custom workflows
-   Multimodal input capabilities with text output, allowing you to upload images (such as tables, graphs, and photos) along with text prompts for richer context and complex use cases
-   [Developer Console](https://console.anthropic.com) with Workbench and prompt generation tool for easier, more powerful prompting and experimentation
-   [SDKs](../api/client-sdks.html) and [APIs](../api/overview.html) to expedite and enhance development

 |
| **Reliable** | 

-   Very low hallucination rates
-   Accurate over long documents

 |
| **Global** | 

-   Great for coding tasks and fluency in English and non-English languages like Spanish and Japanese
-   Enables use cases like translation services and broader global utility

 |
| **Cost conscious** | 

-   Family of models balances cost, performance, and intelligence

](#implementing-claude)

Implementing Claude

1

Scope your use case

-   Identify a problem to solve or tasks to automate with Claude.
-   Define requirements: features, performance, and cost.

2

Design your integration

-   Select Claude’s capabilities (e.g., vision, tool use) and models (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) based on needs.
-   Choose a deployment method, such as the Claude API, AWS Bedrock, or Vertex AI.

3

Prepare your data

-   Identify and clean relevant data (databases, code repos, knowledge bases) for Claude’s context.

4

Develop your prompts

-   Use Workbench to create evals, draft prompts, and iteratively refine based on test results.
-   Deploy polished prompts and monitor real-world performance for further refinement.

5

Implement Claude

-   Set up your environment, integrate Claude with your systems (APIs, databases, UIs), and define human-in-the-loop requirements.

6

Test your system

-   Conduct red teaming for potential misuse and A/B test improvements.

7

Deploy to production

-   Once your application runs smoothly end-to-end, deploy to production.

8

Monitor and improve

-   Monitor performance and effectiveness to make ongoing improvements.
