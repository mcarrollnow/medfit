## 

[​

](#prerequisites)

Prerequisites

-   An Anthropic [Console account](https://console.anthropic.com/)
-   An [API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)

Call the API

-   cURL
-   Python
-   TypeScript
-   Java

1

Set your API key

Get your API key from the [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) and set it as an environment variable:

Copy

```shellscript
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

2

Make your first API call

Run this command to create a simple web search assistant:

Copy

```shellscript
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d '{

    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "What should I search for to find the latest developments in renewable energy?"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Example output:**

Copy
