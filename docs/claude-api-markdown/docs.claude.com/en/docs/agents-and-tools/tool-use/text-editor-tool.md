# Text editor tool

Copy page

Claude can use an Anthropic-defined text editor tool to view and modify text files, helping you debug, fix, and improve your code or other text documents. This allows Claude to directly interact with your files, providing hands-on assistance rather than just suggesting changes.

## 

[​

](#model-compatibility)

Model compatibility

| Model | Tool Version |
| --- | --- |
| Claude 4.x models | `text_editor_20250728` |
| Claude Sonnet 3.7 | `text_editor_20250124` |
| Claude Sonnet 3.5 ([deprecated](../../about-claude/model-deprecations.html)) | `text_editor_20241022` |

Claude Sonnet 3.5 ([deprecated](../../about-claude/model-deprecations.html)) requires the `computer-use-2024-10-22` beta header when using the text editor tool.The text editor tool is generally available in Claude 4 models and Claude Sonnet 3.7.

The `text_editor_20250728` tool for Claude 4 models does not include the `undo_edit` command. If you require this functionality, you’ll need to use Claude Sonnet 3.7 or Sonnet 3.5 with their respective tool versions.

Older tool versions are not guaranteed to be backwards-compatible with newer models. Always use the tool version that corresponds to your model version.

## 

[​

](#when-to-use-the-text-editor-tool)

When to use the text editor tool

Some examples of when to use the text editor tool are:

-   **Code debugging**: Have Claude identify and fix bugs in your code, from syntax errors to logic issues.
-   **Code refactoring**: Let Claude improve your code structure, readability, and performance through targeted edits.
-   **Documentation generation**: Ask Claude to add docstrings, comments, or README files to your codebase.
-   **Test creation**: Have Claude create unit tests for your code based on its understanding of the implementation.

## 

[​

](#use-the-text-editor-tool)

Use the text editor tool

-   Claude 4
-   Claude Sonnet 3.7
-   Claude Sonnet 3.5 (deprecated)

Provide the text editor tool (named `str_replace_based_edit_tool`) to Claude using the Messages API.You can optionally specify a `max_characters` parameter to control truncation when viewing large files.

`max_characters` is only compatible with `text_editor_20250728` and later versions of the text editor tool.

Shell

Python

TypeScript

Java

Copy

```shellscript
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "text_editor_20250728",
        "name": "str_replace_based_edit_tool",
        "max_characters": 10000
      }
    ],
    "messages": [

        "content": "There'\''s a syntax error in my primes.py file. Can you help me fix it?"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

The text editor tool can be used in the following way:

1

Provide Claude with the text editor tool and a user prompt

-   Include the text editor tool in your API request
-   Provide a user prompt that may require examining or modifying files, such as “Can you fix the syntax error in my code?”

2

Claude uses the tool to examine files or directories

-   Claude assesses what it needs to look at and uses the `view` command to examine file contents or list directory contents
-   The API response will contain a `tool_use` content block with the `view` command

3

Execute the view command and return results

-   Extract the file or directory path from Claude’s tool use request
-   Read the file’s contents or list the directory contents
-   If a `max_characters` parameter was specified in the tool configuration, truncate the file contents to that length
-   Return the results to Claude by continuing the conversation with a new `user` message containing a `tool_result` content block

4

Claude uses the tool to modify files

-   After examining the file or directory, Claude may use a command such as `str_replace` to make changes or `insert` to add text at a specific line number.
-   If Claude uses the `str_replace` command, Claude constructs a properly formatted tool use request with the old text and new text to replace it with

5

Execute the edit and return results

-   Extract the file path, old text, and new text from Claude’s tool use request
-   Perform the text replacement in the file
-   Return the results to Claude

6

Claude provides its analysis and explanation

-   After examining and possibly editing the files, Claude provides a complete explanation of what it found and what changes it made

Text editor tool commands

The text editor tool supports several commands for viewing and modifying files:

#### 

[​

](#view)

view

The `view` command allows Claude to examine the contents of a file or list the contents of a directory. It can read the entire file or a specific range of lines. Parameters:

-   `command`: Must be “view”
-   `path`: The path to the file or directory to view
-   `view_range` (optional): An array of two integers specifying the start and end line numbers to view. Line numbers are 1-indexed, and -1 for the end line means read to the end of the file. This parameter only applies when viewing files, not directories.

Example view commands

Copy

```json
// Example for viewing a file
{
  "type": "tool_use",
  "id": "toolu_01A09q90qw90lq917835lq9",
  "name": "str_replace_editor",
  "input": {
    "command": "view",
    "path": "primes.py"
  }
}

// Example for viewing a directory
{
  "type": "tool_use",
  "id": "toolu_02B19r91rw91mr917835mr9",
  "name": "str_replace_editor",
  "input": {
    "command": "view",
    "path": "src/"
  }
}
```

#### 

[​

](#str-replace)

str\_replace

The `str_replace` command allows Claude to replace a specific string in a file with a new string. This is used for making precise edits. Parameters:

-   `command`: Must be “str\_replace”
-   `path`: The path to the file to modify
-   `old_str`: The text to replace (must match exactly, including whitespace and indentation)
-   `new_str`: The new text to insert in place of the old text

Example str\_replace command

Copy

```json
{
  "type": "tool_use",
  "id": "toolu_01A09q90qw90lq917835lq9",
  "name": "str_replace_editor",
  "input": {
    "command": "str_replace",
    "path": "primes.py",
    "old_str": "for num in range(2, limit + 1)",
    "new_str": "for num in range(2, limit + 1):"
  }
}
```

#### 

[​

](#create)

create

The `create` command allows Claude to create a new file with specified content. Parameters:

-   `command`: Must be “create”
-   `path`: The path where the new file should be created
-   `file_text`: The content to write to the new file

  }
}
```

#### 

[​

](#insert)

insert

The `insert` command allows Claude to insert text at a specific location in a file. Parameters:

-   `command`: Must be “insert”
-   `path`: The path to the file to modify
-   `insert_line`: The line number after which to insert the text (0 for beginning of file)
-   `new_str`: The text to insert

Example insert command

Copy

```json
{

        "content": "There'\''s a syntax error in my primes.py file. Can you help me fix it?"
      }
    ]

```

Claude will use the text editor tool first to view the file:

Copy

```json
{
  "id": "msg_01XAbCDeFgHiJkLmNoPQrStU",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "stop_reason": "tool_use",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "I'll help you fix the syntax error in your primes.py file. First, let me take a look at the file to identify the issue."
    },
    {

```

Your application should then read the file and return its contents to Claude:

                }
            ]
        }
    ]
  }'
```

**Line numbers**In the example above, the `view` tool result includes file contents with line numbers prepended to each line (e.g., “1: def is\_prime(n):”). Line numbers are not required, but they are essential for successfully using the `view_range` parameter to examine specific sections of files and the `insert_line` parameter to add content at precise locations.

Claude will identify the syntax error and use the `str_replace` command to fix it:

Copy

```json
{
  "id": "msg_01VwXyZAbCdEfGhIjKlMnO",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "stop_reason": "tool_use",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "I found the syntax error in your primes.py file. In the `get_primes` function, there is a missing colon (:) at the end of the for loop line. Let me fix that for you."
    },
    {
      "type": "tool_use",
      "id": "toolu_01PqRsTuVwXyZAbCdEfGh",
      "name": "str_replace_based_edit_tool",
      "input": {
        "command": "str_replace",
        "path": "primes.py",
        "old_str": "    for num in range(2, limit + 1)",
        "new_str": "    for num in range(2, limit + 1):"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Your application should then make the edit and return the result:

                }
            ]
        }
    ]

](#implement-the-text-editor-tool)

Implement the text editor tool

The text editor tool is implemented as a schema-less tool. When using this tool, you don’t need to provide an input schema as with other tools; the schema is built into Claude’s model and can’t be modified. The tool type depends on the model version:

-   **Claude 4**: `type: "text_editor_20250728"`
-   **Claude Sonnet 3.7**: `type: "text_editor_20250124"`
-   **Claude Sonnet 3.5 ([deprecated](../../about-claude/model-deprecations.html))**: `type: "text_editor_20241022"`

1

Initialize your editor implementation

Create helper functions to handle file operations like reading, writing, and modifying files. Consider implementing backup functionality to recover from mistakes.

2

Handle editor tool calls

Create a function that processes tool calls from Claude based on the command type:

Copy

```python
def handle_editor_tool(tool_call, model_version):
    input_params = tool_call.input
    command = input_params.get('command', '')
    file_path = input_params.get('path', '')
    
    if command == 'view':
        # Read and return file contents
        pass
    elif command == 'str_replace':
        # Replace text in file
        pass
    elif command == 'create':
        # Create new file
        pass
    elif command == 'insert':
        # Insert text at location
        pass
    elif command == 'undo_edit':
        # Check if it's a Claude 4 model
        if 'str_replace_based_edit_tool' in model_version:
            return {"error": "undo_edit command is not supported in Claude 4"}
        # Restore from backup for Claude 3.7/3.5
        pass
```

3

Implement security measures

Add validation and security checks:

-   Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal
-   Create backups before making changes
-   Handle errors gracefully
-   Implement permissions checks

4

Process Claude's responses

Extract and handle tool calls from Claude’s responses:

Copy

```python
# Process tool use in Claude's response
for content in response.content:
    if content.type == "tool_use":
        # Execute the tool based on command
        result = handle_editor_tool(content)
        
        # Return result to Claude
        tool_result = {
            "type": "tool_result",
            "tool_use_id": content.id,
            "content": result
        }
```

When implementing the text editor tool, keep in mind:

1.  **Security**: The tool has access to your local filesystem, so implement proper security measures.
2.  **Backup**: Always create backups before allowing edits to important files.
3.  **Validation**: Validate all inputs to prevent unintended changes.
4.  **Unique matching**: Make sure replacements match exactly one location to avoid unintended edits.

###

](#handle-errors)

Handle errors

When using the text editor tool, various errors may occur. Here is guidance on how to handle them:

File not found

If Claude tries to view or modify a file that doesn’t exist, return an appropriate error message in the `tool_result`:

Copy

```json
{
  "role": "user",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "tool_result",
      "tool_use_id": "toolu_01A09q90qw90lq917835lq9",
      "content": "Error: File not found",
      "is_error": true
    }
  ]
}
```
Multiple matches for replacement

If Claude’s `str_replace` command matches multiple locations in the file, return an appropriate error message:

Copy

```json
{
  "role": "user",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "tool_result",
      "tool_use_id": "toolu_01A09q90qw90lq917835lq9",
      "content": "Error: Found 3 matches for replacement text. Please provide more context to make a unique match.",
      "is_error": true
    }
  ]
}
```
No matches for replacement

If Claude’s `str_replace` command doesn’t match any text in the file, return an appropriate error message:

Copy

```json
{
  "role": "user",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "tool_result",
      "tool_use_id": "toolu_01A09q90qw90lq917835lq9",
      "content": "Error: No match found for replacement. Please check your text and try again.",
      "is_error": true
    }
  ]
}
```
Permission errors

If there are permission issues with creating, reading, or modifying files, return an appropriate error message:

Copy

```json
{
  "role": "user",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "tool_result",
      "tool_use_id": "toolu_01A09q90qw90lq917835lq9",
      "content": "Error: Permission denied. Cannot write to file.",
      "is_error": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### 

[​

](#follow-implementation-best-practices)

Follow implementation best practices

Provide clear context

When asking Claude to fix or modify code, be specific about what files need to be examined or what issues need to be addressed. Clear context helps Claude identify the right files and make appropriate changes.**Less helpful prompt**: “Can you fix my code?”**Better prompt**: “There’s a syntax error in my primes.py file that prevents it from running. Can you fix it?”

Be explicit about file paths

Specify file paths clearly when needed, especially if you’re working with multiple files or files in different directories.**Less helpful prompt**: “Review my helper file”**Better prompt**: “Can you check my utils/helpers.py file for any performance issues?”

Create backups before editing

Implement a backup system in your application that creates copies of files before allowing Claude to edit them, especially for important or production code.

Copy

```python
def backup_file(file_path):
    """Create a backup of a file before editing."""
    backup_path = f"{file_path}.backup"
    if os.path.exists(file_path):
        with open(file_path, 'r') as src, open(backup_path, 'w') as dst:
            dst.write(src.read())
```
Handle unique text replacement carefully

The `str_replace` command requires an exact match for the text to be replaced. Your application should ensure that there is exactly one match for the old text or provide appropriate error messages.

Copy

```python
def safe_replace(file_path, old_text, new_text):
    """Replace text only if there's exactly one match."""
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
    
    count = content.count(old_text)
    if count == 0:
        return "Error: No match found"
    elif count > 1:
        return f"Error: Found {count} matches"
    else:
        new_content = content.replace(old_text, new_text)
        with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
            f.write(new_content)
        return "Successfully replaced text"
```
Verify changes

After Claude makes changes to a file, verify the changes by running tests or checking that the code still works as expected.

Copy

```python
def verify_changes(file_path):
    """Run tests or checks after making changes."""
    try:
        # For Python files, check for syntax errors
        if file_path.endswith('.py'):
            import ast
            with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
                ast.parse(f.read())
            return "Syntax check passed"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Verification failed: {str(e)}"
```
