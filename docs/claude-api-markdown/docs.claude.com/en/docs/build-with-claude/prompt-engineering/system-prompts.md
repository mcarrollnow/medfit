# Giving Claude a role with a system prompt

Copy page

Copy page

While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](extended-thinking-tips.html).

When using Claude, you can dramatically improve its performance by using the `system` parameter to give it a role. This technique, known as role prompting, is the most powerful way to use system prompts with Claude. The right role can turn Claude from a general assistant into your virtual domain expert!

**System prompt tips**: Use the `system` parameter to set Claude’s role. Put everything else, like task-specific instructions, in the `user` turn instead.

## 

[​

](#why-use-role-prompting%3F)

Why use role prompting?

-   **Enhanced accuracy:** In complex scenarios like legal analysis or financial modeling, role prompting can significantly boost Claude’s performance.
-   **Tailored tone:** Whether you need a CFO’s brevity or a copywriter’s flair, role prompting adjusts Claude’s communication style.
-   **Improved focus:** By setting the role context, Claude stays more within the bounds of your task’s specific requirements.

How to give Claude a role

Use the `system` parameter in the [Messages API](../../../api/messages.html) to set Claude’s role:

Copy

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
    max_tokens=2048,
    system="You are a seasoned data scientist at a Fortune 500 company.", # <-- role prompt
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this dataset for anomalies: <dataset>{{DATASET}}</dataset>"}
    ]
)

print(response.content)
```

**Role prompting tip**: Experiment with roles! A `data scientist` might see different insights than a `marketing strategist` for the same data. A `data scientist specializing in customer insight analysis for Fortune 500 companies` might yield different results still!

Examples

###

](#example-1%3A-legal-contract-analysis)

Example 1: Legal contract analysis

Without a role, Claude might miss critical issues:

Legal contract analysis without role prompting

| Role | Content |
| --- | --- |
| User | Analyze this software licensing agreement for potential risks:  
<contract>  
{{CONTRACT}}  
</contract>  
  
Focus on indemnification, liability, and IP ownership. |
| Assistant | Here’s a summary of the key points in the software licensing agreement:  
  
1\. Indemnification (Section 8):  
\- We indemnify the vendor against claims arising from our use.  
  
2\. Limitation of Liability (Section 9):  
\- Damages capped at $500.  
  
3\. IP Ownership (Section 12):  
\- We retain ownership of our modifications.  
  
Overall, the agreement seems standard. The indemnification and liability clauses are typical, and we maintain our IP rights. |

With a role, Claude catches critical issues that could cost millions:

Legal contract analysis with role prompting

| Role | Content |
| --- | --- |
| User | You are the General Counsel of a Fortune 500 tech company. We’re considering this software licensing agreement for our core data infrastructure:  
<contract>  
{{CONTRACT}}  
</contract>  
  
Analyze it for potential risks, focusing on indemnification, liability, and IP ownership. Give your professional opinion. |
| Assistant | I’ve reviewed the software licensing agreement, and I have serious concerns that could expose our company to significant risks:  
  
1\. Indemnification (Section 8):  
\- Critical Issue: We indemnify the vendor against “any and all claims” arising from our use.  
\- Risk: This could hold us liable even for the vendor’s negligence or product defects.  
\- Recommendation: Reject. Limit our indemnity to claims arising from our violation of the agreement.  
  
2\. Limitation of Liability (Section 9):  
\- Critical Issue: Damages capped at $500, including direct damages.  
\- Risk: Grossly inadequate. A critical failure in our data infrastructure could cost us millions in lost revenue and reputational damage.  
\- Recommendation: Reject. Negotiate for cap at 12 months of fees for direct damages, and carve-outs for data breaches.  
  
3\. IP Ownership (Section 12):  
\- Critical Issue: Vendor gains joint ownership of our modifications and integrations.  
\- Risk: They could use or sell our proprietary algorithms or data insights to competitors.  
\- Recommendation: Reject. We must retain full ownership of our work.  
  
Professional Opinion: Do not sign this agreement. It is grossly unfavorable and exposes us to unacceptable levels of risk. If the vendor refuses to renegotiate these terms, I strongly advise exploring alternative providers or accelerating our in-house solution. The potential costs of proceeding with this agreement far outweigh any short-term gains. |

Example 2: Financial analysis

Without a role, Claude’s analysis lacks depth:

Financial analysis without role prompting

| Role | Content |
| --- | --- |
| User | Analyze this dataset of our Q2 financials:  
<data>  
{{FINANCIALS}}  
</data>  
  
Highlight key trends and recommend actions. |
| Assistant | Here’s a summary of your Q2 financials:  
  
1\. Revenue: $15.2M, up 22% YoY. Enterprise client base grew 30%.  
2\. Gross Margin: 72%, up 3% from Q1.  
3\. EBITDA Margin: 18%, down 2% due to R&D investments.  
4\. Cash Flow: $4.1M operating, $28M in reserves.  
  
Overall, financials look strong with revenue growth and healthy margins. Increased R&D spending is impacting profitability but could pay off long-term. Maintain current course. |

With a role, Claude delivers actionable insights:

Financial analysis with role prompting

| Role | Content |
| --- | --- |
| User | You are the CFO of a high-growth B2B SaaS company. We’re in a board meeting discussing our Q2 financials:  
<data>  
{{FINANCIALS}}  
</data>  
  
Analyze key trends, flag concerns, and recommend strategic actions. Our investors want aggressive growth but are wary of our burn rate. |
| Assistant | Board members, here’s my analysis of our Q2 financials:  
  
1\. Revenue ($15.2M, +22% YoY):  
\- Insight: Enterprise growth (+30%) is outpacing overall growth.  
\- Flag: SMB segment declined 5%.  
\- Action: Reallocate 20% of SMB marketing budget to enterprise sales. Task product to simplify SMB onboarding.  
  
2\. Margins (Gross: 72%, +3% QoQ; EBITDA: 18%, -2% QoQ):  
\- Insight: Infrastructure optimizations boosted gross margins.  
\- Flag: R&D spend on AI features dented EBITDA.  
\- Action: No change. Our AI roadmap is critical for enterprise stickiness.  
  
3\. Cash ($4.1M OCF, $28M reserves):  
\- Insight: 15-month runway at current burn.  
\- Flag: CAC up 20%, eroding LTV/CAC.  
\- Action: Freeze non-essential hires. Implement sales funnel analytics to cut CAC by 15% in Q3.  
  
Strategic Stance: We’re threading the needle between growth and burn. Enterprise focus is our growth engine—invest there. But watch SMB churn; it could bleed into enterprise. Our AI bet is sound, but we must convert it to ARR by Q4, or we cut R&D by 30%.  
  
In sum: Double down on enterprise, streamline SMB, optimize sales, and monetize AI. Questions? |
