    -   **Custom Skills**: Upload your own Skills via the Skills API (`/v1/skills` endpoints) to package domain expertise and organizational workflows
    -   Skills require the [code execution tool](../docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool.html) to be enabled
    -   Learn more in our [Agent Skills documentation](../docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview.html) and [API reference](../api/skills/create-skill.html)

#### 

[​

](#september-3%2C-2025)

September 3, 2025

August 11, 2025

-   Some customers might encounter 429 (`rate_limit_error`) [errors](../api/errors.html) following a sharp increase in API usage due to acceleration limits on the API. Previously, 529 (`overloaded_error`) errors would occur in similar scenarios.

#### 

[​

](#august-8%2C-2025)

August 8, 2025

-   Search result content blocks are now generally available on the Claude API and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI. This feature enables natural citations for RAG applications with proper source attribution. The beta header `search-results-2025-06-09` is no longer required.

#### 

[​

](#july-24%2C-2025)

July 24, 2025

-   We’ve increased [rate limits](../api/rate-limits.html) for Claude Opus 4 on the Claude API to give you more capacity to build and scale with Claude. For customers with [usage tier 1-4 rate limits](../api/rate-limits.html#rate-limits), these changes apply immediately to your account - no action needed.

#### 

[​

](#july-21%2C-2025)

July 21, 2025

#### 

[​

](#july-17%2C-2025)

July 17, 2025

-   We’ve increased [rate limits](../api/rate-limits.html) for Claude Sonnet 4 on the Claude API to give you more capacity to build and scale with Claude.

#### 

[​

](#july-3%2C-2025)

July 3, 2025

-   We’ve launched search result content blocks in beta, enabling natural citations for RAG applications. Tools can now return search results with proper source attribution, and Claude will automatically cite these sources in its responses - matching the citation quality of web search. This eliminates the need for document workarounds in custom knowledge base applications. Learn more in our [search results documentation](../docs/build-with-claude/search-results.html). To enable this feature, use the beta header `search-results-2025-06-09`.

#### 

[​

](#june-30%2C-2025)

-   Console users with the Developer role can now access the [Cost](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/cost) page. Previously, the Developer role allowed access to the [Usage](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/usage) page, but not the Cost page.

#### 

[​

](#june-11%2C-2025)

June 11, 2025

-   We’ve launched [fine-grained tool streaming](../docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/fine-grained-tool-streaming.html) in public beta, a feature that enables Claude to stream tool use parameters without buffering / JSON validation. To enable fine-grained tool streaming, use the [beta header](../api/beta-headers.html) `fine-grained-tool-streaming-2025-05-14`.

#### 

[​

](#may-22%2C-2025)

May 22, 2025

-   We’ve launched [Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4](http://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4), our latest models with extended thinking capabilities. Learn more in our [Models & Pricing documentation](../docs/about-claude/models/overview.html).
-   The default behavior of [extended thinking](../docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking.html) in Claude 4 models returns a summary of Claude’s full thinking process, with the full thinking encrypted and returned in the `signature` field of `thinking` block output.
-   We’ve launched [interleaved thinking](../docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking.html#interleaved-thinking) in public beta, a feature that enables Claude to think in between tool calls. To enable interleaved thinking, use the [beta header](../api/beta-headers.html) `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14`.
-   We’ve launched the [Files API](../docs/build-with-claude/files.html) in public beta, enabling you to upload files and reference them in the Messages API and code execution tool.
-   We’ve launched the [Code execution tool](../docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool.html) in public beta, a tool that enables Claude to execute Python code in a secure, sandboxed environment.
-   We’ve launched the [MCP connector](../docs/agents-and-tools/mcp-connector.html) in public beta, a feature that allows you to connect to remote MCP servers directly from the Messages API.
-   To increase answer quality and decrease tool errors, we’ve changed the default value for the `top_p` [nucleus sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-p_sampling) parameter in the Messages API from 0.999 to 0.99 for all models. To revert this change, set `top_p` to 0.999. Additionally, when extended thinking is enabled, you can now set `top_p` to values between 0.95 and 1.
-   We’ve moved our [Go SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-go) from beta to GA.
-   We’ve included minute and hour level granularity to the [Usage](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/usage) page of Console alongside 429 error rates on the Usage page.

#### 

[​

](#may-21%2C-2025)

May 21, 2025

-   We’ve moved our [Ruby SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-ruby) from beta to GA.

#### 

[​

](#may-7%2C-2025)

May 7, 2025

-   We’ve launched a web search tool in the API, allowing Claude to access up-to-date information from the web. Learn more in our [web search tool documentation](../docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool.html).

#### 

[​

](#may-1%2C-2025)

May 1, 2025

-   Cache control must now be specified directly in the parent `content` block of `tool_result` and `document.source`. For backwards compatibility, if cache control is detected on the last block in `tool_result.content` or `document.source.content`, it will be automatically applied to the parent block instead. Cache control on any other blocks within `tool_result.content` and `document.source.content` will result in a validation error.

#### 

[​

](#april-9th%2C-2025)

April 9th, 2025

-   We launched a beta version of the [Ruby SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-ruby)

#### 

[​

](#march-31st%2C-2025)

March 31st, 2025

-   We’ve moved our [Java SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-java) from beta to GA.

#### 

[​

](#february-27th%2C-2025)

February 27th, 2025

-   We’ve added URL source blocks for images and PDFs in the Messages API. You can now reference images and PDFs directly via URL instead of having to base64-encode them. Learn more in our [vision documentation](../docs/build-with-claude/vision.html) and [PDF support documentation](../docs/build-with-claude/pdf-support.html).
-   We’ve added support for a `none` option to the `tool_choice` parameter in the Messages API that prevents Claude from calling any tools. Additionally, you’re no longer required to provide any `tools` when including `tool_use` and `tool_result` blocks.
-   We’ve launched an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint, allowing you to test Claude models by changing just your API key, base URL, and model name in existing OpenAI integrations. This compatibility layer supports core chat completions functionality. Learn more in our [OpenAI SDK compatibility documentation](../api/openai-sdk.html).

#### 

[​

](#february-24th%2C-2025)

February 24th, 2025

-   We’ve launched [Claude Sonnet 3.7](http://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet), our most intelligent model yet. Claude Sonnet 3.7 can produce near-instant responses or show its extended thinking step-by-step. One model, two ways to think. Learn more about all Claude models in our [Models & Pricing documentation](../docs/about-claude/models/overview.html).
-   We’ve added vision support to Claude Haiku 3.5, enabling the model to analyze and understand images.

-   We’ve released updated versions of our tools that decouple the text edit and bash tools from the computer use system prompt:
    -   `bash_20250124`: Same functionality as previous version but is independent from computer use. Does not require a beta header.
    -   `text_editor_20250124`: Same functionality as previous version but is independent from computer use. Does not require a beta header.
    -   `computer_20250124`: Updated computer use tool with new command options including “hold\_key”, “left\_mouse\_down”, “left\_mouse\_up”, “scroll”, “triple\_click”, and “wait”. This tool requires the “computer-use-2025-01-24” anthropic-beta header. Learn more in our [tool use documentation](../docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview.html).
