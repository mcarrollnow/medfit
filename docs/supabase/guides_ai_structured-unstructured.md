# Structured and Unstructured

## Supabase is flexible enough to associate structured and unstructured metadata with embeddings.

* * *

Most vector stores treat metadata associated with embeddings like NoSQL, unstructured data. Supabase is flexible enough to store unstructured and structured metadata.

## Structured [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/structured-unstructured\#structured)

```flex

```

Notice that we've associated two pieces of metadata, `content` and `url`, with the embedding. Those fields can be filtered, constrained, indexed, and generally operated on using the full power of SQL. Structured metadata fits naturally with a traditional Supabase application, and can be managed via database [migrations](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/deployment/database-migrations).

## Unstructured [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/structured-unstructured\#unstructured)

```flex

```

An unstructured approach does not specify the metadata fields that are expected. It stores all metadata in a flexible `json`/ `jsonb` column. The tradeoff is that the querying/filtering capabilities of a schemaless data type are less flexible than when each field has a dedicated column. It also pushes the burden of metadata data integrity onto application code, which is more error prone than enforcing constraints in the database.

The unstructured approach is recommended:

- for ephemeral/interactive workloads e.g. data science or scientific research
- when metadata fields are user-defined or unknown
- during rapid prototyping

Client libraries like python's [vecs](https://github.com/supabase/vecs) use this structure. For example, running:

```flex

```

automatically creates the unstructured SQL table during the call to `get_or_create_collection`.

Note that when working with client libraries that emit SQL DDL, like `create table ...`, you should add that SQL to your migrations when moving to production to maintain a single source of truth for your database's schema.

## Hybrid [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/structured-unstructured\#hybrid)

The structured metadata style is recommended when the fields being tracked are known in advance. If you have a combination of known and unknown metadata fields, you can accommodate the unknown fields by adding a `json`/ `jsonb` column to the table. In that situation, known fields should continue to use dedicated columns for best query performance and throughput.

```flex

```

## Choosing the right model [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/structured-unstructured\#choosing-the-right-model)

Both approaches create a table where you can store your embeddings and some metadata. You should choose the best approach for your use-case. In summary:

- Structured metadata is best when fields are known in advance or query patterns are predictable e.g. a production Supabase application
- Unstructured metadata is best when fields are unknown/user-defined or when working with data interactively e.g. exploratory research

Both approaches are valid, and the one you should choose depends on your use-case.
