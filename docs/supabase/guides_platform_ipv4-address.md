# Dedicated IPv4 Address for Ingress

## Attach an IPv4 address to your database

* * *

The Supabase IPv4 add-on provides a dedicated IPv4 address for your Postgres database connection. It can be configured in the [Add-ons Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/addons).

## Understanding IP addresses [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/ipv4-address\#understanding-ip-addresses)

The Internet Protocol (IP) addresses devices on the internet. There are two main versions:

- **IPv4**: The older version, with a limited address space.
- **IPv6**: The newer version, offering a much larger address space and the future-proof option.

## When you need the IPv4 add-on: [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/ipv4-address\#when-you-need-the-ipv4-add-on)

IPv4 addresses are guaranteed to be static for ingress traffic. If your database is making outbound connections, the outbound IP address is not static and cannot be guaranteed.

- When using the direct connection string in an IPv6-incompatible network instead of Supavisor or client libraries.
- When you need a dedicated IP address for your direct connection string

## Enabling the IPv4 add-on [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/ipv4-address\#enabling-the-ipv4-add-on)

You can enable the IPv4 add-on in your project's [add-ons settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/addons).

You can also manage the IPv4 add-on using the Management API:

```flex

```

Note that direct database connections can experience a short amount of downtime when toggling the add-on due to DNS reconfiguration and propagation. Generally, this should be less than a minute.

## Read replicas and IPv4 add-on [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/ipv4-address\#read-replicas-and-ipv4-add-on)

When using the add-on, each database (including read replicas) receives an IPv4 address. Each replica adds to the total IPv4 cost.

## Changes and updates [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/ipv4-address\#changes-and-updates)

- While the IPv4 address generally remains the same, actions like pausing/unpausing the project or enabling/disabling the add-on can lead to a new IPv4 address.

## Supabase and IPv6 compatibility [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/ipv4-address\#supabase-and-ipv6-compatibility)

By default, Supabase Postgres use IPv6 addresses. If your system doesn't support IPv6, you have the following options:

1. **Supavisor Connection Strings**: The Supavisor connection strings are IPv4-compatible alternatives to direct connections
2. **Supabase Client Libraries**: These libraries are compatible with IPv4
3. **Dedicated IPv4 Add-On (Pro Plans+)**: For a guaranteed IPv4 and static database address for the direct connection, enable this paid add-on.

### Checking your network IPv6 support [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/ipv4-address\#checking-your-network-ipv6-support)

You can check if your personal network is IPv6 compatible at [https://test-ipv6.com](https://test-ipv6.com/).

### Checking platforms for IPv6 support: [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/ipv4-address\#checking-platforms-for-ipv6-support)

The majority of services are IPv6 compatible. However, there are a few prominent ones that only accept IPv4 connections:

- [Retool](https://retool.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
- [Render](https://render.com/)

## Finding your database's IP address [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/ipv4-address\#finding-your-databases-ip-address)

Use an IP lookup website or this command (replace `<PROJECT_REF>`):

```flex

```

## Identifying your connections [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/ipv4-address\#identifying-your-connections)

The pooler and direct connection strings can be found in the [project connect page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true):

#### Direct connection [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/ipv4-address\#direct-connection)

IPv6 unless IPv4 Add-On is enabled

```flex

```

#### Supavisor in transaction mode (port 6543) [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/ipv4-address\#supavisor-in-transaction-mode-port-6543)

Always uses an IPv4 address

```flex

```

#### Supavisor in session mode (port 5432) [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/ipv4-address\#supavisor-in-session-mode-port-5432)

Always uses an IPv4 address

```flex

```

## Pricing [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/ipv4-address\#pricing)
