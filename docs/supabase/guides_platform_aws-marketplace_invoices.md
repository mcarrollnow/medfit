# Invoices

* * *

## Where to find your invoices [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/aws-marketplace/invoices\#where-to-find-your-invoices)

You can view your invoices in the [AWS Billing and Cost Management console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/bills) under the "Bills" section.

## What invoices you get from AWS [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/aws-marketplace/invoices\#what-invoices-you-get-from-aws)

You'll receive two invoices for your marketplace subscription.

### Invoice 1 - charge type "subscription" [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/aws-marketplace/invoices\#invoice-1---charge-type-subscription)

- What for: The fixed subscription fee paid in advance
- When: At the time of subscription, and in subsequent months on the same day of the month the subscription was started

### Invoice 2 - charge type "usage" [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/aws-marketplace/invoices\#invoice-2---charge-type-usage)

- What for: Usage that exceeds the quota included in the plan, or usage not covered by the plan (e.g. Custom Domain add-on, IPv4 add-on, additionally provisioned Disk IOPS).
- When: No later than the third day of the month for the previous month. This is independent of your subscription’s billing cycle and instead covers the period from the first to the last day of the previous month.

## More information [\#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/aws-marketplace/invoices\#more-information)

- Detailed explanations of how each usage item is billed, independent of the AWS Marketplace. Refer to the [Manage Your Usage guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage).
